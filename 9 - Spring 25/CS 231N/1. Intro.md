# 1 Course Topics
## 1.1 Deep Learning Basics
* Image classification ⟶ teach a machine to classify an image (i.e. via linear classifiers, neural networks, etc)
* Regularization and optimization ⟶ prevent underfitting and overfitting when models get more complex
* Neural networks ⟶ stack multiple layers to model non-linear functions and behaviors

## 1.2 Perceiving and Understanding the Visual World
* We define **tasks** that we want to solve, and create **models** to solve those tasks.

## 1.3 Generative and Interative Visual Intelligence
* We'll first start with self-supervised learning ⟶ train large scale models without explicit labels

* We'll then go into generative modeling ⟶ style transfer, text to image, diffusion models

* We then also learn visual language models ⟶ text to image, image to text, etc
