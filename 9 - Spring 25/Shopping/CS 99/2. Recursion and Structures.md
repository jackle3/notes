## 1.2 Match
* This is kind of like the switch-case in other languages
	* Takes a value and matches it with several cases, as well as a default cause
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402133519.png)

* If a function simply takes in a value and returns the result of a match, there exists syntatic sugar to define a **function as a match**

# 2 Function Calls
## 2.1 Default Arguments
* Similar to Python, Lean supports **default arguments**
	* In this case, if we don't provide `op` it will use the default `op`
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402133704.png)

## 2.2 Named Arguments
* It can also have **named arguments** to provide arguments out of order
	* In this case, we provide `op` via its name before providing the value `10`
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402133720.png)

## 2.3 Implicit Arguments
* Many functions also have **implicit arguments** represented by curly brackets
	* The `map` function can map from one type to another. We can have implicit arguments that pass those types (via curly brackets) instead of explicitly defining it.
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402133832.png)

## 2.4 Namespaces
* **Namespaces** ⟶ we can call functions belonging to namespaces on values of that namespace directly (e.g. calling `String` functions directly on strings)

![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402134634.png)

## 2.5 Protected
* We can **protect** functions to prevent it from being accessed when we `open` a namespace
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402134205.png)

## 2.6 Sections

## 2.7 Currying
* For functions with multiple arguments, we can pass in some arguments to **return a function with that parameter encoded**
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402134757.png)
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402134909.png)

* In the example below, `List.map` takes in a function and a list
	* We can curry the function `String.length` so that every time we call it, it automatically maps with that function

![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402135124.png)

## 2.8 Fold
* Folds are the idiomatic way to implement "loops" in functional programming
* Suppose we have a list of `[ a, b, c, d]` and an accumulator `acc`
	* `fold` will apply some function to each value and accumulate it into `acc

* In this case:
	* The new `acc` will be `acc + " " + y` where `y` is the current elem
	* The `acc` starts as an empty string
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402135222.png)

### 2.8.1 Other Alternatives to Loops
* We can also use `List.map`, `List.foldl`, `List.filter`, `List.filterMap`, and `List.flatten`

![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402135453.png)

# 3 Recursion
* Like other functional programming languages, Lean has tail recursion
* This recursive function `rec1` uses pattern matching to handle different cases:
	* Base case: When `x = 0`, it returns `1`
	* Recursive case: When `x = y+1` (meaning x is a successor of some number y), it returns `2 + (rec1 y)`
* The pattern `y+1` is crucial because:
	* It simultaneously decomposes `x` into its predecessor `y` (where `x = y+1`)
	* It ensures we only match non-zero natural numbers (since only they can be written as a successor)
* For example, if we call `rec1 5`:
	* It matches the pattern `y+1` with `y = 4`
	* Returns `2 + (rec1 4)`, which becomes `2 + (2 + (rec1 3))`, and so on
	* Eventually reaches `2 + (2 + (2 + (2 + (2 + (rec1 0)))))` = `2 + (2 + (2 + (2 + (2 + 1))))` = `11`
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402135543.png)

## 3.1 Partial Recursion
* Sometimes Lean can't automatically prove that a recursive function terminates
* In these cases, we can use the `partial` keyword to tell Lean to accept the function anyway
* A `partial` function:
	* Doesn't need to terminate on all inputs
	* Bypasses Lean's termination checker
	* Should be used carefully as it can lead to infinite recursion
* In this example, `rec2` is marked as `partial` because:
	* It uses a conditional (`if x == 0`) rather than pattern matching
	* Lean can't automatically verify that `x - 1` always decreases toward the base case
	* The function actually does terminate for all natural numbers, but Lean's termination checker isn't sophisticated enough to prove this automatically
* When we evaluate `rec2 5`:
	* It recursively computes `2 * (rec2 4)`, then `2 * (2 * (rec2 3))`, and so on
	* Eventually reaches the base case and returns `2^5 = 32`
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402135729.png)

## 3.2 Mutual Recursion
* Mutual recursion allows two or more functions to call each other in a cycle
* In Lean, mutually recursive functions must be defined within a `mutual` block
* The example shows two functions `on` and `off` that call each other:
	* `on` returns 1 for inputs ≤ 1, otherwise it calls `off` with a decremented value
	* `off` returns 0 for inputs ≤ 1, otherwise it calls `on` with a decremented value
* This creates an alternating pattern where:
	* For odd numbers > 1, the functions eventually return 1
	* For even numbers > 1, the functions eventually return 0
* For example, calling `on 5` would:
	* Call `off 4`, which calls `on 3`
	* Then call `off 2`, which calls `on 1`
	* Finally return 1 (the base case for `on`)

# 4 Additional Conveniences
## 4.1 Let Expressions
* Let expressions allow you to define local variables within a function or expression
* The basic syntax is `let variable := value; expression`
* In the example:
	* `#eval let x := 5; x + 1` evaluates to `6` (assigns 5 to x, then adds 1)
	* `f_let` defines a function that:
		* Creates a local variable `y` with value `x * 2`
		* Returns `y + y + 1` (which is `2*x + 2*x + 1` or `4*x + 1`)
		* When we evaluate `f_let 10`, we get `41` (4*10 + 1)

![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402140213.png)

## 4.2 Let Rec
* `let rec` is a variant of let that allows you to define recursive functions
* The basic syntax is `let rec variable := value; expression`
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402140316.png)

## 4.3 Sub-functions
* Sub-functions allow you to define helper functions within the scope of another function
* In the example:
	* The function `f` defines a sub-function `g` within its body
	* `g` takes a parameter `y` and returns `y * 2`
	* The main function `f` calls `g` twice with its own parameter `x`
	* When we evaluate `f 10`, it calls `g (g 10)`, which returns `40`
* Sub-functions can access variables from their parent scope
* This is a cleaner alternative to using `let rec` for helper functions that don't need to be exposed outside

## 4.4 Tuples
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402140639.png)

## 4.5 Unit Type
* The Unit Type (`Unit`) is a type that carries no information and is equivalent to an empty tuple
* It has only one value, written as `()`
* Unit is often used as a placeholder when a function needs to take an argument but doesn't actually use it
* In the example:
	* `thunk` is a function that takes a `Unit` parameter and returns a `Nat`
	* The function body computes `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5` (which is 15)
	* When we call `thunk ()`, we pass the unit value `()` and get back 15
* This pattern is useful for delaying computation until it's needed (known as "thunking")

```python
def generateAsteriskPattern : String :=
  let lines := 
    ["\""] ++ 
    List.map (fun i => 
      if i == 0 || i == 1 || i == 4 then
        "  *"
      else if i == 2 then
        "  ***" 
      else if i == 3 then
        "  *****"
      else
        ""
    ) (List.range 5) ++
    ["\""]
  
  String.intercalate "\n" lines

#eval generateAsteriskPattern
```

# 5 Structure
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402140845.png)
* There are a few ways to abbreviate the creation of a structure:
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402140943.png)

## 5.1 Pattern Matching
* Pattern matching allows us to extract fields from a structure in a concise way
* In the example below:
	* The `swap` function takes a `Point` structure and returns a new `Point` with x and y coordinates swapped
	* `let { x, y } := p` extracts the x and y fields from the input point
	* `{ x := y, y := x }` creates a new Point with the values swapped
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402141455.png)

* We can also use more advanced pattern matching with structure fields:
	* Using the `@` symbol to bind the entire structure to a name while also accessing its fields
	* Ignoring specific fields with `_` when we don't need them
	* In the example below, `p'@{ x, y := _ }` binds the swapped point to `p'` while also extracting its `x` value and ignoring its `y` value
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402141508.png)

## 5.2 Structure Inheritance
* Structure inheritance allows us to create new structures by extending existing ones
* In the example below:
	* `Point3` extends `Point` with an additional `z` field
	* `Point3.mk` is a constructor for `Point3` that takes a `Point` and a `z` value
* This allows us to reuse the `Point` constructor and ensure `Point3` always has a `z` value
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402141607.png)

## 5.3 Constructor Renaming
* Constructor renaming allows us to rename the constructor of a structure
* In the example below:
	* `Complex` has a constructor `from2d` that takes a `re` and `im` value
	* `Complex.mk` is a constructor for `Complex` that takes a `Complex.from2d` value
* This allows us to reuse the `Complex.from2d` constructor and ensure `Complex` always has a `re` and `im` value
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402141721.png)

# 6 Inductive
* Inductive types allow us to define custom data types with different constructors
* They're similar to enums in other languages, but more powerful because constructors can hold data
## 6.1 Basic Inductive Types
* The example below defines a `Weekday` type with four constructors:
	* Three simple constructors: `monday`, `tuesday`, and `wednesday`
	* One constructor `thursday` that takes a parameter `color` of type `Nat`
* We can then define functions that pattern match on these constructors
* The function `f` maps each weekday to a natural number, with `thursday` using its color parameter
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402141825.png)

## 6.2 Nested Pattern Matching on Inductive Types
* We can perform nested pattern matching on inductive types
* In the example below:
	* The function `f'` takes an `Option Weekday` parameter
	* It pattern matches on both the `Option` type and the `Weekday` type in a nested fashion
	* `.none` matches when the input is `None`
	* `.some .monday` matches specifically when the input is `Some(monday)`
	* `.some z` matches any other `Some` value, binding the inner value to `z`
* This allows for concise handling of complex nested data structures
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402141853.png)

## 6.3 Recursive Inductive
* Inductive types can be recursive, meaning they can refer to themselves in their definition
* This allows us to define data structures like linked lists or trees
* In the example below:
	* `FakeNat` is a recursive inductive type that represents natural numbers
	* It has two constructors:
		* `zero` represents the number 0
		* `succ` takes a `FakeNat` parameter `prev` and represents the successor of that number
	* The function `toNat` converts a `FakeNat` to a regular `Nat` by recursively processing the structure
		* For `zero`, it returns 0
		* For `succ prev`, it recursively converts `prev` to a `Nat` and adds 1
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402142053.png)

### 6.3.1 Strict Positivity
* Inductive types must satisfy the **strict positivity** condition:
	* This means that the type being defined can only appear in "positive positions" in the arguments of its constructors
	* A positive position is either:
		* The return type of a function
		* An argument to a type constructor
	* It cannot appear in a negative position, such as the argument type of a function
	* This restriction prevents logical paradoxes and ensures termination of recursive functions
	* The example below shows an invalid inductive type that violates strict positivity by having `Bad` appear in a function argument position (`Bad → Bad`)

![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402142456.png)

* Unlike other languages where `match` is a primitive (e.g. if/else statements), in Lean it's defined in terms of a recursor
