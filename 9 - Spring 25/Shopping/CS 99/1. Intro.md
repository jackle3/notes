# 1 Lean
Lean is a language that is:
* Purely functional ⟶ functions may not have side effects. All values are immutable
* Eagerly evaluated ⟶ Lean does not wait until the last moment to evaluate expressions
* Garbage collectioned ⟶ the user does not have to do memory management
* Statically typed ⟶ each value has a type known at compile time. Type incompatability will signal an error at compile tile.
