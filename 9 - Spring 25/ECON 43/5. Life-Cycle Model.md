# 1 Lecture 5: Life-Cycle Model, Salary Negotiation, and Social Security

## 1.1 Life-Cycle Model of Consumption

### 1.1.1 Nobel Prize Winners
- Milton Friedman
- Franco Modigliani
- Angus Deaton

### 1.1.2 Key Concepts
1. **Income Smoothing**
   - Income is typically "hump-shaped" over life
   - Consumption should be smoother than income
   - Example: If paid $3,000 bi-weekly, prefer $1,500 weekly consumption
   - Requires saving half of paycheck for next week

2. **Diminishing Marginal Utility**
   - More consumption leads to smaller utility gains
   - Smoothing consumption increases total utility
   - Peaks and troughs in consumption are suboptimal

3. **Long-Term Planning**
   - Two-year example: Prefer $60,000/year over $80,000/$40,000
   - Save in high-income years for low-income years
   - Borrowing against future earnings is difficult ("liquidity constrained")

### 1.1.3 Life-Cycle Income Pattern
- Sharp rise in earnings (20-40 years)
- Peak earnings â‰ˆ 3x starting earnings
- Flat earnings (40-55 years)
- Modest decline (55-75 years)
- Retirement typically in 60s

## 1.2 Reasons to Save

### 1.2.1 Retirement Planning
- Need to finance consumption without labor income
- Save during high-income years
- Draw down savings in retirement
- Social Security provides partial income replacement

### 1.2.2 Precautionary Motive
- Future earnings are uncertain
- Need "rainy day fund" for emergencies
- Recommended: 3-6 months of earnings
- Keep savings relatively liquid
- Acts as insurance against shocks

### 1.2.3 Bequest Motive
- Satisfaction from leaving money to heirs
- Extends time horizon beyond lifetime
- Example: Philanthropic giving by wealthy individuals

## 1.3 Earnings and Education

### 1.3.1 College Major Earnings (Early Career)
- Computer Engineering: $80,000
- Computer Science: $78,000
- Finance: $66,000
- Economics: $65,000
- Business Analytics: $65,000
- History/Fine Arts: $40,000

### 1.3.2 Mid-Career Earnings (10 Years after graduation)
- Economics: $98,600 (90th percentile: $210,000)
- Computer Science: $95,500 (90th percentile: $154,000)
- Mathematics: $92,400 (90th percentile: $183,000)
- Philosophy: $81,200 (90th percentile: $168,000)
- History: $71,000 (90th percentile: $149,000)
- Psychology: $60,400 (90th percentile: $127,000)

## 1.4 Salary Negotiation

### 1.4.1 Importance
- Affects starting wages and future promotions
- Particularly crucial for women
- Wages increase as percentage of initial pay
- Consider full compensation package

### 1.4.2 Negotiation Strategy
1. **Research**
   - Market rates
   - Company policies
   - Industry standards

2. **Assessment**
   - Personal priorities
   - Growth opportunities
   - Cost of living
   - State/local taxes

3. **Preparation**
   - Develop strategy
   - Practice negotiation
   - Consider total compensation

## 1.5 Social Security

### 1.5.1 Key Features
- Main income source for most retirees
- Benefits adjusted annually for inflation
- Functions as lifetime annuity
- Replacement rates:
  - Low income: ~75% of wages
  - Middle income: 40-50% of wages
  - High income: Lower replacement rate

### 1.5.2 Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) System
- Current workers' taxes fund current retirees
- No investment of tax receipts
- Budget constraint: $Nwt = Rb$
  - $N$ = Number of workers
  - $w$ = Average wage
  - $t$ = Tax rate
  - $R$ = Number of retirees
  - $b$ = Average benefit

### 1.5.3 Current Status
- Worker-to-beneficiary ratio: 2.7 (declining to 2.3)
- Current tax rates:
  - Retirement: 10.6% (up to $160,200)
  - Disability: 1.8% (up to $160,200)
  - Medicare: 2.9% (all earnings)
  - Total: 15.3% (up to $160,200), 2.9% thereafter

### 1.5.4 Future Outlook
- System needs changes for sustainability
- Possible solutions:
  - Increased means-testing
  - Higher taxes
  - Benefit cuts
  - Increased borrowing

## 1.6 Common Financial Mistakes
1. Not negotiating salary
2. Early Social Security withdrawal (age 62)
3. Insufficient retirement savings
4. Ignoring life-cycle income pattern

## 1.7 Key Takeaways
1. Smooth consumption is preferred over tracking income
2. Save for retirement during high-income years
3. Consider lifetime resources, not just current income
4. Young workers face liquidity constraints
5. Maintain precautionary savings for emergencies
6. Social Security requires reform for long-term sustainability
7. Salary negotiation significantly impacts lifetime earnings
