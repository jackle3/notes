# 1 Lecture 13: Options & Derivatives

## 1.1 Introduction to Options
- Options provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specified price
- Key characteristics:
  - Exercise/Strike Price (X)
  - Expiration Date
  - Number of shares (typically multiples of 100)
- Options cannot have negative value - can always be discarded
- Option writers grant rights to buyers in exchange for premium payment

## 1.2 Types of Options
### 1.2.1 Call Options
- Right to BUY shares at specified price within time period
- Payoff = Max[0, S_T - X]
- "In the money" when stock price > exercise price
- "Out of the money" when stock price < exercise price
- "At the money" when stock price = exercise price

### 1.2.2 Put Options
- Right to SELL shares at specified price within time period
- Payoff = Max[0, X - S_T]
- "In the money" when stock price < exercise price
- "Out of the money" when stock price > exercise price

## 1.3 Option Strategies

1. Buy a call
2. Write/sell a call
3. Buy a put

### 1.3.2 Advanced Strategies
1. **Covered Call**
   - Own stock + sell call option
   - Limited upside but generates income
   - Example: Own $60 stock, sell $70 call for $3
   - Maximum profit: $13 ($70 - $60 + $3)
   - Risk: Stock price decline

2. **Protective Put**
   - Own stock + buy put option
   - Limits downside risk
   - Example: Buy $60 stock + $55 put for $2
   - Maximum loss: $7 ($60 - $55 + $2)
   - Unlimited upside potential

3. **Collar**
   - Own stock + buy put + sell call
   - Limits both upside and downside
   - Example: Buy stock + $140 put + sell $190 call
   - Defined risk and reward range

4. **Straddle**
   - Buy both call and put with same strike price
   - Profits from large price movements in either direction
   - Maximum loss: Cost of both options
   - Used to bet on volatility
