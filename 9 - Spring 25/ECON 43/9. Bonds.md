# Lecture 9: Bonds and Other Fixed Income Assets

## Introduction to Bonds

### Key Concepts
- Bonds are debt instruments representing loans to issuers
- Contrast with equity (ownership stake)
- Bondholders have priority over equity holders in bankruptcy
- Order of priority: Senior debt → Junior debt → Hybrids → Preferred stock → Common stock

### Global Bond Market Overview
- Total size: ~$135 trillion
- Composition: ~2/3 government, ~1/3 corporate
- U.S. market: $51.3 trillion (39% of global market)
- China: $20.9 trillion (16%)
- Japan: $11.0 trillion (8%)

## Types of Bonds and Issuers

### Government Bonds
- U.S. Treasury securities
  - Bills: ≤ 1 year
  - Notes: 2-10 years
  - Bonds: 20-30 years
- Municipal bonds (tax-exempt)
  - General obligation bonds
  - Revenue bonds
- Government-backed entities (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac)

### Corporate Bonds
- Investment grade
- High yield (junk bonds)
- Convertible bonds
- Asset-backed securities

## Bond Mechanics

### Key Terms
- Face Value: Principal amount
- Coupon Rate: Annual interest rate
- Maturity Date: Repayment date
- Yield to Maturity (YTM): Total return if held to maturity
- Current Yield: Annual coupon payment / Market price

### Bond Pricing
1. **Zero-Coupon Bonds**
   - No periodic payments
   - Sold at discount
   - YTM formula: $YTM_n = \left(\frac{FV}{P}\right)^{1/n} - 1$

2. **Coupon Bonds**
   - Regular interest payments
   - Price formula: $P = CPN \cdot \frac{1}{y} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + y)^{n}} \right) + \frac{FV}{(1 + y)^{n}}$
   - Where:
     - $P$ = Price
     - $CPN$ = Coupon payment
     - $y$ = Yield
     - $n$ = Number of periods
     - $FV$ = Face value

### Bond Price Relationships
- Discount: Price < Face value
- Par: Price = Face value
- Premium: Price > Face value
- Inverse relationship between price and yield
- Convex price-yield curve

## Bond Risks

### Interest Rate Risk
- Bond prices fall when rates rise
- Duration measures sensitivity
- Longer duration = higher sensitivity
- Price changes more for longer maturities

### Inflation Risk
- Fixed payments lose purchasing power
- Real interest rate = Nominal rate - Inflation
- TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities)
  - Principal adjusts with CPI
  - Coupon payments adjust accordingly

### Default Risk
- Credit ratings (AAA to D)
- Rating agencies: Moody's, S&P
- Higher risk = higher yield
- Municipal bonds: Tax-exempt status

## Bond Investment Strategies

### Laddering
- Multiple maturity dates
- Reduces reinvestment risk
- Enables rate response
- Example: 10-year ladder with equal rungs

### Immunization
- Match asset and liability durations
- Price risk = Reinvestment risk
- Used by institutions
- Protects against rate changes

## Tax Considerations

### Municipal Bonds
- Federal tax exemption
- State/local tax exemption
- Taxable equivalent yield formula:
  $Taxable\ Equivalent\ Yield = \frac{Tax-exempt\ return}{1.0 - Tax\ rate}$

### Corporate Bonds
- Fully taxable
- Higher yields compensate for taxes
- Consider after-tax returns

## Key Takeaways
1. Bonds are essential for portfolio diversification
2. Understanding bond mechanics is crucial for pricing
3. Multiple risks affect bond returns
4. Tax status significantly impacts yields
5. Duration helps manage interest rate risk
6. Laddering provides flexibility
7. Immunization protects against rate changes
