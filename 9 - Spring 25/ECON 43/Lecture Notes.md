# 2 Intro to Finance
## 2.1 Current Financial Landscape
- **Increasing risks**: Changes in macroeconomy and financial markets
- **Growing complexity**: ETFs, crypto assets, derivatives
- **Easy access**: Investment and credit options (e.g., Buy Now, Pay Later)
- **Rising student debt**: Currently at $1.7 trillion
- **Changing retirement landscape**: Individuals now function as their own CFO (Chief Financial Officer)

## 2.2 Financial Literacy Statistics
- Knowledge is particularly low among young people (18-29 age group)
- Does not improve over successive cohorts
- P-Fin Index (Personal Finance Index) shows financial literacy holding steady around 48-52% from 2017-2024
- Young adults (18-29): 38% score under 26% correct on financial literacy tests
- Only 8% of young adults score above 75% correct

## 2.3 What is Finance?
- Management of money: budgeting, investing, saving, borrowing, lending
- Divided into three categories:
	1. **Personal finance**: Individual/household financial decisions
	2. **Business/Corporate finance**: Financial activities of corporations
	3. **Public (government) finance**: Government funding and spending

## 2.4 Important Financial Terms
- **Money**: Medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value
- **Payment Systems**: How transactions are conducted and settled
- **Income**: Flows of resources (wages, dividends, interest, etc.)
- **Saving**: Portion of income not spent (borrowing money is called negative saving)
- **Wealth**: Accumulated savings, also called net worth (assets minus liabilities)
- **Stocks**: Ownership shares in companies
- **Bonds**: Fixed income instruments (loans by an investor to companies/governments)
- **Derivatives**: Securities derived from underlying assets
	- Securities are financial instruments that represent ownership or debt
	- Common types are options, futures, forwards, and swaps
		- Options: Contracts giving the right (but not obligation) to buy/sell an asset at a set price by a certain date
		- Futures: Agreements to buy/sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific future date
		- Forwards: Similar to futures but customized and traded directly between parties, not on exchanges
		- Swaps: Agreements to exchange cash flows or other financial items between parties
	- Used for hedging ⟶ reduce risk by offsetting potential losses with gains in other areas
- **Liquidity**: How easily an asset can be converted to cash
- **Solvency**: Measure of a business's ability to meet long-term debt obligations
- **Credit**: Ability to borrow with promise of future payment
- **Leverage**: How much debt a person has relative to equity (capital)

### 2.4.1 Additional Details
- **Debt/Equity Ratio**: Measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt
	- The higher the D/E, the higher the interest rate a company will have to pay to borrow (must pay more if they already have more debt)
- **Liquidity vs. Solvency**:
	- Liquidity is the ability to meet short-term financial obligations
	- Solvency is the ability to meet long-term financial obligations (key to a company's ability to continue operating)

## 2.5 Types of Businesses
- **Corporations (C and S)**: Legal entities separate from owners that offer limited liability, with C-corps taxed at corporate level and S-corps passing income to shareholders.
- **LLC**: Business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of partnerships with the limited liability of corporations.
- **Partnerships**: Business arrangements where two or more individuals share ownership, profits, and liabilities.
- **Sole Proprietorships**: Unincorporated businesses owned and operated by a single individual with unlimited personal liability.
- **Mutual Form**: Organizations owned by their customers/members rather than external shareholders, commonly seen in insurance companies and credit unions.
- **State Owned or Sponsored Enterprises**: Businesses owned or significantly controlled by government entities to serve public interests.

### 2.5.1 Corporations
- For larger companies, partnerships are not practical due to the number of owners/shareholders
- Corporations have stocks that can be bought and sold, easy transferability of ownership
- Corporations offer limited liability ⟶ shareholders are not personally liable for the company's debts

# 3 Major Financial Decisions We All Face
1. **Budgeting**
	- Understanding current and forecasting future income/expenses
	- Balancing income, spending, and saving/investing
2. **Making a Living**
	- Job searching and comparing offers
	- Understanding benefits and negotiating employment terms
3. **Insurance**
	- Health, auto, home, life, unemployment, disability
4. **Major Expenditures**
	- Housing (buying vs. renting)
	- Transportation
5. **Credit Management**
	- Using credit responsibly via credit cards
	- Building good credit history
6. **Taxes**
	- Understanding tax obligations (federal, state, payroll, sales, and property taxes)
	- Strategies to legally minimize taxes
7. **Saving and Investing**
	- Building wealth for emergencies, education, retirement
	- Understanding investment options

## 3.1 Financial Mistakes
- Lack of financial planning
- Frivolous spending/living paycheck-to-paycheck
- Poor debt management and failing to establish good credit
- Failing to invest or diversify investments
- Blindly trusting others with financial management

## 3.2 Money and Happiness
- Money provides freedom, choices, and security
- Research (Kahneman & Killingsworth) shows happiness increases with income
- Diminishing returns apply (more pronounced at higher income levels)
- Happiness linked to spending on:
	- Reducing financial anxiety ⟶ money is the largest source of stress (above relationships)
	- Experiences (travel, learning)
	- Helping others
	- Freeing up time
- Easterlin Paradox: happiness is linked to *relative* income (happiness levels constant as average incomes increase)

# 4 Financial Risk and Return
## 4.1 Risk and Uncertainty
- **Risk**: Situations where outcomes and probabilities can be identified
- **Uncertainty**: Inability to quantify information about outcomes ⟶ implies a limit to knowledge
- **Black swan events**: Important but unpredictable events
- Financial decisions involve evaluating risk-return tradeoffs
	- The risk of two or more investments may have returns and risks which are related ⟶ requires thinking about both in relation to each other

## 4.2 Basic Probability
- **Mean (aka expected value)**: denoted $\mu$, the sample mean of a rand var $X$ weights each outcome $x_i$ by its probability
$$
\mu = \sum x_i \cdot p_i
$$
- **Variance**: denoted $\sigma^2$, measures how far away from the mean outcomes may be. If a random variable $X$ has expected value $\mu$, the variance is expected value of $(X - \mu)^2$
$$
\sigma^2 = \sum (x_i - \mu)^2 \cdot p_i
$$
- Law of Large Numbers ⟶ as sample size increases, sample statistics approach true population statistics.
- **Covariance**: denotes relationship between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ (e.g. two stocks). Defined as the expected value of $(X - \mu_x) \cdot (Y - \mu_y)$
$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \sum \sum (x_i - \mu_x) (y_j - \mu_y) \cdot p(x_i, y_j)
$$
- **Correlation**: the ratio of the covariance between $X$ and $Y$ to the square root of the product of their variances. This is just rescaling so that the correlation is between $-1$ and $+1$

## 4.3 Ways to Mitigate Risk
- Less risky behavior and financial decisions
- Hedging ⟶ reducing risk by offsetting potential losses with gains in other areas
- Diversification ⟶ reducing risk by spreading investments across different assets
- Insurance ⟶ transferring risk to an insurance company
- Don't forget returns ⟶ riskier investments have higher returns

# 5 Major Financial Markets
- **Stock Markets**:
	- Traditional stock exchanges (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ) and their international counterparts
	- Off-exchange electronic trading (now approaching 50% of all trading)
	- Private placements (e.g. venture capital, angel investing)
- **Bond Markets**:
	- Sometimes categorized by credit worthiness of issuer (e.g. investment grade, high yield junk bonds)
	- Often speak about bond markets by sector of issuer (e.g. US treasury, municipal, corporate)
- **Options and Futures Markets (derivative markets)**:
	- Markets for derivatives ⟶ financial instruments that derive value from an underlying asset
	- Common derivatives include futures, options, and swaps
	- Derivatives are used to hedge risk and speculate on price movements
	- Major derivatives exchanges include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), and the International Monetary Market (IMM)
- Nowadays, most financing is done through private placements off exchanges (e.g. private equity, private funding rounds)

# 6 Major Types of Financial Products
- **Loans**: from banks, governments, and other institutions
- **Bonds**: fixed income instruments (loans by an investor to companies/governments), of different maturities, ratings, and seniority
- **Stocks**: regular and preferred, individual shares or fractional shares
- **Asset backed securities**: e.g. mortgages, etc
- **Mutual Funds**: professionally managed portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other securities (active vs. passive, e.g. index funds like S&P 500)
- **Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)**: baskets of stocks, bonds, or other securities that trade on an exchange like a stock
- **Options and Futures**: derivatives on assets like stocks, stock indices, bonds, interest rates, commodities, etc.
- **Insurance products**: life, health, auto, home, disability, long-term care, etc.
- **Real estate mortgages**: commercial and residential real estate

# 7 Regulatory and Institutional Framework
- **Regulatory Framework**:
	- **Federal Reserve System (Fed)**: central bank of the United States
	- **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**: oversees the U.S. stock markets
	- **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)**: oversees the U.S. futures markets
	- **Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)**: oversees the U.S. broker-dealer industry

## 7.1 Major Laws
- **Securities Act of 1933**: requires companies to register securities with the SEC before selling them to the public
- **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**: regulates the trading of securities on U.S. exchanges
- **Banking Act of 1935**: created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits in U.S. banks
- **Glass-Steagall Act of 1933**: separated commercial banking from investment banking
- **Trust Indenture Act of 1939**: regulates the issuance of debt securities (e.g. bonds)
- **Investment Company Act of 1940**: regulates mutual funds

## 7.2 Bank Runs, Bailouts, and Financial Crises
- **Bank Runs**: when depositors rush to withdraw their funds from a bank, fearing that the bank may not have enough cash to meet the demand
- **Bailouts**: when governments or central banks step in to save a bank from collapse
- **Financial Crises**: when a large number of financial institutions fail, leading to a loss of confidence in the financial system
- In cases like these, the Federal Reserve acts as a lender of last resort ⟶ provides liquidity to the financial system

# 8 Basic Model: Supply and Demand
- **Demand**: the amount of a financial product that buyers are willing and able to purchase at a given price
	- Demand curve slopes downward ⟶ as prices increase, quantity demanded decreases
	- Describes the behavior of consumers ⟶ consumers will demand less of a product at higher prices
- **Supply**: the amount of a financial product that sellers are willing and able to sell at a given price
	- Supply curve slopes upward ⟶ as prices increase, quantity supplied increases
	- Describes the behavior of producers ⟶ sellers will supply more at higher prices to maximize profits
- **Market Equilibrium**: the point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied
	- Prices tend towards the equilibrium and stay (unless external forces shift the supply/demand curves)
![](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250402130426.png)
- **Shifts in Demand and/or Supply**:
	- When demand shifts right (increase in demand), equilibrium price and quantity both increase
	- When supply shifts right (increase in supply), equilibrium price decreases and quantity increases
