## 1.4 What is Finance?
- Management of money: budgeting, investing, saving, borrowing, lending
- Divided into three categories:
	1. **Personal finance**: Individual/household financial decisions
	2. **Business/Corporate finance**: Financial activities of corporations
	3. **Public (government) finance**: Government funding and spending

## 1.5 Important Financial Terms
- **Money**: Medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value
- **Payment Systems**: How transactions are conducted and settled
- **Income**: Flows of resources (wages, dividends, interest, etc.)
- **Saving**: Portion of income not spent (borrowing money is called negative saving)
- **Wealth**: Accumulated savings, also called net worth (assets minus liabilities)
- **Stocks**: Ownership shares in companies
- **Bonds**: Fixed income instruments (loans by an investor to companies/governments)
- **Derivatives**: Securities derived from underlying assets
	- Securities are financial instruments that represent ownership or debt
	- Common types are options, futures, forwards, and swaps
		- Options: Contracts giving the right (but not obligation) to buy/sell an asset at a set price by a certain date
		- Futures: Agreements to buy/sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific future date
		- Forwards: Similar to futures but customized and traded directly between parties, not on exchanges
		- Swaps: Agreements to exchange cash flows or other financial items between parties
	- Used for hedging ⟶ reduce risk by offsetting potential losses with gains in other areas
- **Liquidity**: How easily an asset can be converted to cash
- **Solvency**: Measure of a business's ability to meet long-term debt obligations
- **Credit**: Ability to borrow with promise of future payment
- **Leverage**: How much debt a person has relative to equity (capital)

### 1.5.1 Additional Details
- **Debt/Equity Ratio**: Measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt
	- The higher the D/E, the higher the interest rate a company will have to pay to borrow (must pay more if they already have more debt)
- **Liquidity vs. Solvency**:
	- Liquidity is the ability to meet short-term financial obligations
	- Solvency is the ability to meet long-term financial obligations (key to a company's ability to continue operating)

## 1.6 Types of Businesses
- **Corporations (C and S)**: Legal entities separate from owners that offer limited liability, with C-corps taxed at corporate level and S-corps passing income to shareholders.
- **LLC**: Business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of partnerships with the limited liability of corporations.
- **Partnerships**: Business arrangements where two or more individuals share ownership, profits, and liabilities.
- **Sole Proprietorships**: Unincorporated businesses owned and operated by a single individual with unlimited personal liability.
- **Mutual Form**: Organizations owned by their customers/members rather than external shareholders, commonly seen in insurance companies and credit unions.
- **State Owned or Sponsored Enterprises**: Businesses owned or significantly controlled by government entities to serve public interests.

### 1.6.1 Corporations
- For larger companies, partnerships are not practical due to the number of owners/shareholders
- Corporations have stocks that can be bought and sold, easy transferability of ownership
- Corporations offer limited liability ⟶ shareholders are not personally liable for the company's debts

## 1.9 Money and Happiness
- Money provides freedom, choices, and security
- Research (Kahneman & Killingsworth) shows happiness increases with income
- Diminishing returns apply (more pronounced at higher income levels)
- Happiness linked to spending on:
	- Reducing financial anxiety ⟶ money is the largest source of stress (above relationships)
	- Experiences (travel, learning)
	- Helping others
	- Freeing up time
- Easterlin Paradox: happiness is linked to *relative* income (happiness levels constant as average incomes increase)

## 1.10 Risk and Uncertainty
- **Risk**: Situations where outcomes and probabilities can be identified
- **Uncertainty**: Inability to quantify information about outcomes ⟶ implies a limit to knowledge
- **Black swan events**: Important but unpredictable events
- Financial decisions involve evaluating risk-return tradeoffs
