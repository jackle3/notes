# 1 Lecture 8: Diversification & Portfolios

## 1.1 Introduction to Diversification

### 1.1.1 Key Principles
- Single sector funds don't provide true diversification
- Better to hold stocks from multiple sectors
- Consider funds covering most/all of the market
- Diversification is crucial for risk management

### 1.1.2 Historical Returns (1802-2012)
| Asset Class | Annualized Real Return |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Stocks      | 6.60%                 |
| Bonds       | 3.60%                 |
| Bills       | 2.70%                 |
| Gold        | 0.70%                 |
| U.S. Dollar | -1.40%                |

## 1.2 Investment Strategies

### 1.2.1 Small Capitalization Stocks
- S&P 500 represents ~75% of total market cap
- Some evidence of better long-run returns
- Can invest through Russell 2000 funds

### 1.2.2 Preferred Stock
- Fixed dividend payments
- Cumulative preferreds: missed dividends must be paid before common dividends
- Less common than common stock

### 1.2.3 International Diversification

#### 1.2.3.1 Global Market Overview
- Total global market cap: ~$125 trillion (2025)
- U.S. market cap: $52.01 trillion
- U.S. listed companies: 4,642 (2022)

#### 1.2.3.2 Pros and Cons
1. **Pros**
   - Enhanced diversification
   - Access to global growth
   - Reduced country-specific risk

2. **Cons**
   - Different accounting standards
   - Higher transaction costs
   - Exchange rate risk
   - Less familiarity with companies

## 1.3 Advanced Trading Strategies

### 1.3.1 Short Selling
1. **Process**
   - Borrow shares from broker
   - Sell borrowed shares
   - Buy back later to cover position
   - Profit if price falls

2. **Risks**
   - Unlimited potential losses
   - Example: Amazon short at $1,900 â†’ $3,000
   - Safer alternatives: options

### 1.3.2 Buying on Margin
1. **Mechanics**
   - Borrow up to 100% of investment
   - 2x leverage example
   - Magnifies both gains and losses

2. **Requirements**
   - Position as collateral
   - Margin calls if value drops
   - Interest rates: 10-12%

## 1.4 Portfolio Management

### 1.4.1 Asset Allocation
1. **Basic Strategy**
   - Multiple asset types
   - Different industries
   - Various company sizes
   - International exposure
   - Classic: 70% stocks, 30% bonds

2. **Advanced Allocation**
   - 40% U.S. large cap
   - 10% U.S. small cap
   - 20% foreign equities
   - 30% bonds

### 1.4.2 Rebalancing
- Regular intervals (6-12 months)
- Special rebalancing after major market moves
- Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk

## 1.5 Portfolio Theory

### 1.5.1 Key Metrics
1. **Expected Return**
   - Future-oriented
   - Based on historical data
   - Formula: $E(r) = \sum P(s) \times r(s)$

2. **Risk (Variance/Standard Deviation)**
   - Volatility measure
   - Historical formula: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum(r_t - r_A)^2$
   - Standard deviation = $\sqrt{\sigma^2}$

### 1.5.2 Portfolio Mathematics

1. **Two-Asset Portfolio**
   - Expected return: $E(r) = w_1E(r_1) + w_2E(r_2)$
   - Variance: $Var(r) = w_1^2Var(r_1) + w_2^2Var(r_2) + 2w_1w_2Cov(r_1,r_2)$

2. **Correlation and Covariance**
   - Range: $-1$ to $+1$
   - Formula: $\rho = \frac{Cov(x,y)}{\sigma_x \times \sigma_y}$
   - Zero correlation = independent returns

### 1.5.3 Efficient Frontier
- Minimum risk for given expected return
- Individual stocks never on frontier
- Markowitz Portfolio Theory
- Nobel Prize-winning work

## 1.6 Practical Examples

### 1.6.1 Example 1: Safe Bond + Equity Fund
- 50% in 4% government bonds ($\sigma = 0$)
- 50% in 9% equity fund ($\sigma = 20\%$)
- Result: 6.5% expected return, $\sigma = 10\%$

### 1.6.2 Example 2: SPY + BND Portfolio
- SPY (S&P 500 ETF): 10% expected return, $\sigma = 20\%$
- BND (Bond ETF): 5% expected return, $\sigma = 5\%$
- Correlation: $\rho = 0.00$ (2019-2024)
- Even risk-averse investors should hold some SPY

## 1.7 Key Takeaways
1. Diversification is essential for risk management
2. International exposure can enhance returns
3. Advanced strategies (shorting, margin) carry significant risks
4. Regular rebalancing maintains target allocation
5. Portfolio theory provides framework for optimal allocation
6. Efficient frontier shows best risk-return combinations
7. Even small equity allocations can improve risk-adjusted returns
