# 1 Lecture 10: Bonds and Other Fixed Income Assets Continued

## 1.1 Zero-Coupon Bonds and Yield Curves

### 1.1.1 Zero-Coupon Bond Pricing
- No periodic payments
- Sold at discount
- YTM formula: $YTM_n = \left(\frac{FV}{P}\right)^{1/n} - 1$
- Example calculations for different maturities:
  - 1 year: $YTM_1 = (100/96.62) - 1 = 3.50\%$
  - 2 years: $YTM_2 = (100/92.45)^{1/2} - 1 = 4.00\%$
  - 3 years: $YTM_3 = (100/87.63)^{1/3} - 1 = 4.50\%$
  - 4 years: $YTM_4 = (100/83.06)^{1/4} - 1 = 4.75\%$

### 1.1.2 Term Structure of Interest Rates
- Spot Interest Rate: Default-free, zero-coupon yield
- Yield Curve: Plot of yields vs. maturity
- Usually upward sloping
- Downward slope may indicate economic slowdown
- Factors affecting shape:
  - Expected future rates
  - Liquidity preferences
  - Inflation expectations
  - Risk premiums

## 1.2 Coupon Bonds and Returns

### 1.2.1 Coupon Bond Mechanics
- Regular interest payments
- Face value at maturity
- Price formula: $P = CPN \cdot \frac{1}{y} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1+y)^{n}} \right) + \frac{FV}{(1+y)^{n}}$
- Current Yield = Annual Coupon / Market Price

### 1.2.2 Holding Period Returns
- YTM vs. Actual Realized Return
- Components:
  - Coupon payments
  - Reinvestment income
  - Capital gains/losses
- Example: 8% coupon bond sold after 6 months
  - Initial price: $1,000
  - Sale price: $1,068.55
  - Coupon: $40
  - HPR = 10.85% (6-month return)

## 1.3 Bond Duration and Risk Management

### 1.3.1 Duration Concepts
- Macauley Duration: Time to recover investment
- Modified Duration: Price sensitivity to rate changes
- Longer duration = Higher sensitivity
- Zero-coupon bonds: Duration = Maturity

### 1.3.2 Bond Laddering Strategy
- Multiple maturity dates
- Benefits:
  - Rate response flexibility
  - Reinvestment risk reduction
  - Diversification
- Example: 10-year ladder with equal rungs
- Price sensitivity by maturity:
  | Time to Maturity | 2% Rate | 4% Rate | 6% Rate | 8% Rate | 10% Rate |
  |------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
  | 1 Year           | 105.91  | 103.88  | 101.91  | 100.00  | 98.14    |
  | 10 Year          | 154.14  | 132.70  | 114.88  | 100.00  | 87.54    |
  | 20 Year          | 198.50  | 154.71  | 123.12  | 100.00  | 82.84    |
  | 30 Year          | 234.87  | 169.52  | 127.68  | 100.00  | 81.07    |

### 1.3.3 Immunization Strategy
- Match asset and liability durations
- Price risk = Reinvestment risk
- Used by institutions
- Case Study: Silicon Valley Bank
  - Bought 10-year Treasuries at 2%
  - Rates rose to 4.8%
  - 20% value loss

## 1.4 Inflation Protection and Risk

### 1.4.1 TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities)
- Principal adjusts with CPI
- Coupon payments adjust accordingly
- Maturities: 5, 10, 30 years
- Minimum $1,000 denomination
- Example: 1% rate, 5% inflation
  - $100 principal → $105
  - $1 payment → $1.05

### 1.4.2 Bond Ratings and Default Risk
- Rating Agencies: Moody's, S&P
- Investment Grade: AAA to BBB
- High Yield (Junk): Below BBB
- Impact on yields:
  - 2% yield increase → 17% value decrease
  - Higher risk = Higher compensation

## 1.5 Tax Considerations

### 1.5.1 Municipal Bonds
- Federal tax exemption
- State/local tax exemption
- Taxable equivalent yield:
  $Taxable\ Equivalent\ Yield = \frac{Tax-exempt\ return}{1.0 - Tax\ rate}$
- Example: 3% muni, 28% tax bracket
  - Equivalent yield = 4.17%

## 1.6 Key Takeaways

2. Coupon bonds require careful return calculation
3. Duration helps manage interest rate risk
4. Laddering provides flexibility and risk reduction
5. TIPS protect against inflation
6. Bond ratings significantly impact yields
7. Tax status affects effective returns
8. Historical returns show corporate premium over government bonds
