# 1 Interest and Future Values
Interest rate is the price of money ⟶ it is what you have to pay for using someone else's money
- **Saving**: interest rate is what you receive in return for lending your money to someone ⟶ rate at which savings grow over time
- **Borrowing**: interest rate is waht you pay for usng money ⟶ rate at which debt grows over time

**Time value of money**: money today is worth more than same amount in future bc of earning potential
- If you invest $10,000 today at 2% interest per year, it would grow to $10,200 next year
	- $200 is the interest
	- $10,200 is the value due after 1 period (known as **Future Value**)
$$\text{FV} = C_0 \times (1 + r) \tag{one period, $C_0$ is initial amount}$$
- **Compound interest**: you earn interest not just on initial amount but on interest as well
$$
\text{FV} = [C_0 \times (1 + r)]\times (1 + r) = C_0\times (1 + r)^2 \tag{two periods}
$$
- The general formula over many periods is:

The convention is that money you pay is entered as negative numbers and money you receive as positive numbers

## 1.3 Compounding Periods
So far, interest has compounded once per period (i.e. $m = 1$). It can compound multiple times per period:

## 2.1 Series of Cash Flows
You may put in a fixed number of **constant** payments at certain time intervals ⟶ e.g. saving per month, paying mortgage each month, etc.
