# 1 Lecture 3: Time Value of Money and the Annuity Formula

## 1.1 Introduction to Time Value of Money

### 1.1.1 The Price of Money: Interest Rate
- Interest rate is the price of money
- For savers: Rate at which savings grow over time
- For borrowers: Rate at which debt grows over time

### 1.1.2 Core Concept
- A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow
- Money available today has earning potential
- Example: $1,000 today at 2% interest = $1,020 in one year

## 1.2 Future Value Calculations

### 1.2.1 One-Period Case
- Formula: $FV = C_0(1 + r)$
- Where:
  - $C_0$ = Initial amount
  - $r$ = Interest rate
  - $FV$ = Future value

### 1.2.2 Two-Period Case
- Formula: $FV = C_0(1 + r)^2$
- Compound interest: Earn interest on both principal and accumulated interest
- Example: $100 at 10% for 2 years
  - Year 1: $100(1.10) = $110
  - Year 2: $110(1.10) = $121
  - Total interest: $21 ($20 on principal + $1 on interest)

### 1.2.3 Multi-Period Case
- Formula: $FV = C_0(1 + r)^T$
- Where $T$ = number of periods
- Note: $T$ and $r$ must use consistent time units

## 1.3 The Power of Compounding

### 1.3.1 Key Factors
1. **Initial Investment ($C_0$)**
   - Starting amount matters
2. **Interest Rate ($r$)**
   - Higher rates = faster growth
   - Example: 8% vs 4% over 30 years
3. **Time Horizon ($T$)**
   - Longer time = greater compounding effect
   - Example: Starting at age 20 vs 50

### 1.3.2 Rule of 72
- Quick way to estimate doubling time
- Formula: $T = \frac{72}{r}$
- Example: At 8% interest, money doubles in 9 years

## 1.4 Present Value Calculations

### 1.4.1 One-Period Case
- Formula: $PV = \frac{FV}{1 + r}$
- Example: $1,000 in one year at 5% = $952.38 today

### 1.4.2 Multi-Period Case
- Formula: $PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^T}$
- Where:
  - $FV$ = Future value
  - $r$ = Interest rate
  - $T$ = Number of periods

## 1.5 Series of Cash Flows

### 1.5.1 Present Value of Multiple Payments
- Formula: $PV = \frac{C}{1+r} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^2} + \dots + \frac{C}{(1+r)^t}$
- Simplified formula: $PV = \frac{C}{r} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}\right)$
- Where $C$ = Constant payment amount

### 1.5.2 Applications
- Auto loans
- Mortgages
- Regular savings
- Investment returns

## 1.6 Interest Rate Conventions

### 1.6.1 Compounding Periods
- Formula: $FV = C_0 \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{mt}$
- Where:
  - $m$ = Number of compounding periods per year
  - $t$ = Number of years
  - $r$ = Annual interest rate (APR)

### 1.6.2 Annual Percentage Rate (APR) Vs Effective Annual Rate (EAR)
- APR: Stated annual rate
- EAR: Actual rate after compounding
- Example: Credit card at 23.65% APR
  - Daily rate: 23.65%/365 = 0.0648%
  - EAR: $(1 + 0.000648)^{365} = 1.2667$ (26.67%)

## 1.7 Practical Applications

### 1.7.1 Auto Loans
- Example: $12,000 annual payment
- 5-year loan at 7% interest
- Maximum car price: $49,202

### 1.7.2 Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Not starting to save early enough
2. Leaving money idle in checking accounts
3. Carrying large credit card balances while having liquid assets

## 1.8 Key Takeaways
1. Time value of money is fundamental to financial decision-making
2. Compounding interest is powerful for both savings and debt
3. Starting early and maintaining consistent savings is crucial
4. Understanding present and future values helps in financial planning
5. Different compounding periods affect actual returns
6. Rule of 72 provides quick estimates for investment growth
7. Series of cash flows are common in real-world financial situations
