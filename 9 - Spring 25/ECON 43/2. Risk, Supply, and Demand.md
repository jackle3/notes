# 1 Lecture 2: Introduction to Financial Decision-Making II

## 1.1 Risk and Statistics

### 1.1.1 Risk vs. Uncertainty
- **Risk**: Quantifiable outcomes with known probabilities
  - Example: Weather forecast with 30% chance of rain
- **Uncertainty**: Unquantifiable outcomes
  - Implies a limit to knowledge
- **Black Swan Events**: Unpredictable, high-impact events
  - Example: Inventions that seem inconceivable at the time

### 1.1.2 Financial Risk and Return
- Investments involve potential returns through:
  - Dividends
  - Capital gains
  - Bond yields
- Risk relationships between investments:
  - Returns and risks may be related
  - Portfolio risk depends on relationships between assets
  - Risk must be compensated (risk-adjusted returns)

### 1.1.3 Statistical Measures
- **Mean (μ)**: Center of location/expected value
  - For symmetric distributions, equals center value
  - For skewed distributions (e.g., income), median differs from mean
- **Variance (σ²)**: Measure of spread
  - Expected value of (xi - μ)²
  - Square root is standard deviation (σ)
- **Covariance**: Relationship between variables
  - Expected value of (xi - μx) * (yi - μy)
  - Positive: Variables move together
  - Negative: Variables move in opposite directions
- **Correlation (ρ)**: Standardized measure of relationship
  - Range: -1 to +1
  - Rescaled covariance
