# 1 Financial Risk and Return
## 1.1 Risk and Uncertainty
- **Risk**: Situations where outcomes and probabilities can be identified
- **Uncertainty**: Inability to quantify information about outcomes ⟶ implies a limit to knowledge
- **Black swan events**: Important but unpredictable events
- Financial decisions involve evaluating risk-return tradeoffs
	- The risk of two or more investments may have returns and risks which are related ⟶ requires thinking about both in relation to each other

## 1.2 Basic Probability
- **Mean (aka expected value)**: denoted $\mu$, the sample mean of a rand var $X$ weights each outcome $x_i$ by its probability
$$
\mu = \sum x_i \cdot p_i
$$

- **Variance**: denoted $\sigma^2$, measures how far away from the mean outcomes may be. If a random variable $X$ has expected value $\mu$, the variance is expected value of $(X - \mu)^2$
$$
\sigma^2 = \sum (x_i - \mu)^2 \cdot p_i
$$

- Law of Large Numbers ⟶ as sample size increases, sample statistics approach true population statistics.
- **Covariance**: denotes relationship between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ (e.g. two stocks). Defined as the expected value of $(X - \mu_x) \cdot (Y - \mu_y)$
$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \sum \sum (x_i - \mu_x) (y_j - \mu_y) \cdot p(x_i, y_j)
$$
- **Correlation**: the ratio of the covariance between $X$ and $Y$ to the square root of the product of their variances. This is just rescaling so that the correlation is between $-1$ and $+1$

### 1.2.2 Useful Formulas

## 1.3 Ways to Mitigate Risk
- Less risky behavior and financial decisions
- Hedging ⟶ reducing risk by offsetting potential losses with gains in other areas
- Diversification ⟶ reducing risk by spreading investments across different assets
- Insurance ⟶ transferring risk to an insurance company
- Don't forget returns ⟶ riskier investments have higher returns

# 2 Major Financial Markets
- **Stock Markets**:
	- Traditional stock exchanges (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ) and their international counterparts
	- Off-exchange electronic trading (now approaching 50% of all trading)
	- Private placements (e.g. venture capital, angel investing)
- **Bond Markets**:
	- Sometimes categorized by credit worthiness of issuer (e.g. investment grade, high yield junk bonds)
	- Often speak about bond markets by sector of issuer (e.g. US treasury, municipal, corporate)
- **Options and Futures Markets (derivative markets)**:
	- Markets for derivatives ⟶ financial instruments that derive value from an underlying asset
	- Common derivatives include futures, options, and swaps
	- Derivatives are used to hedge risk and speculate on price movements
	- Major derivatives exchanges include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), and the International Monetary Market (IMM)
- Nowadays, most financing is done through private placements off exchanges (e.g. private equity, private funding rounds)

# 3 Major Types of Financial Products
- **Loans**: from banks, governments, and other institutions
- **Bonds**: fixed income instruments (loans by an investor to companies/governments), of different maturities, ratings, and seniority
- **Stocks**: regular and preferred, individual shares or fractional shares
- **Asset backed securities**: e.g. mortgages, etc
- **Mutual Funds**: professionally managed portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other securities (active vs. passive, e.g. index funds like S&P 500)
- **Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)**: baskets of stocks, bonds, or other securities that trade on an exchange like a stock
- **Options and Futures**: derivatives on assets like stocks, stock indices, bonds, interest rates, commodities, etc.
- **Insurance products**: life, health, auto, home, disability, long-term care, etc.
- **Real estate mortgages**: commercial and residential real estate

# 4 Regulatory and Institutional Framework
- **Regulatory Framework**:
	- **Federal Reserve System (Fed)**: central bank of the United States
	- **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**: oversees the U.S. stock markets
	- **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)**: oversees the U.S. futures markets
	- **Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)**: oversees the U.S. broker-dealer industry

## 4.1 Major Laws
- **Securities Act of 1933**: requires companies to register securities with the SEC before selling them to the public
- **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**: regulates the trading of securities on U.S. exchanges
- **Banking Act of 1935**: created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits in U.S. banks
- **Glass-Steagall Act of 1933**: separated commercial banking from investment banking
- **Trust Indenture Act of 1939**: regulates the issuance of debt securities (e.g. bonds)
- **Investment Company Act of 1940**: regulates mutual funds

## 4.2 Bank Runs, Bailouts, and Financial Crises
- **Bank Runs**: when depositors rush to withdraw their funds from a bank, fearing that the bank may not have enough cash to meet the demand
- **Bailouts**: when governments or central banks step in to save a bank from collapse
- **Financial Crises**: when a large number of financial institutions fail, leading to a loss of confidence in the financial system
- In cases like these, the Federal Reserve acts as a lender of last resort ⟶ provides liquidity to the financial system

# 5 Basic Model: Supply and Demand
- **Demand**: the amount of a financial product that buyers are willing and able to purchase at a given price
	- Demand curve slopes downward ⟶ as prices increase, quantity demanded decreases
	- Describes the behavior of consumers ⟶ consumers will demand less of a product at higher prices
- **Supply**: the amount of a financial product that sellers are willing and able to sell at a given price
	- Supply curve slopes upward ⟶ as prices increase, quantity supplied increases
	- Describes the behavior of producers ⟶ sellers will supply more at higher prices to maximize profits
- **Market Equilibrium**: the point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied
	- Prices tend towards the equilibrium and stay (unless external forces shift the supply/demand curves)

- **Shifts in Demand and/or Supply**:
	- When demand shifts right (increase in demand), equilibrium price and quantity both increase
	- When supply shifts right (increase in supply), equilibrium price decreases and quantity increases
