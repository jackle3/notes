### 1.1.2 Ways to Increase Net Worth
1. Increase saving (higher income or lower spending)
2. Reduce debt
3. Increase investment value
4. Increase value of possessions

## 1.2 Investment Considerations

### 1.2.1 Key Factors
1. **Income Generation**
   - Regular cash flow from investments

2. **Appreciation**
   - Growth in investment value

3. **Liquidity**
   - Ability to buy/sell quickly
   - Example: Real estate is less liquid

4. **Risk**
   - Safety vs. potential loss
   - Higher risk typically means higher expected returns
   - Risk-return relationship

5. **Time Horizon**
   - Investment duration
   - Affects risk tolerance

### 1.2.2 Investment Vehicles

1. **Bank/Credit Union Accounts**
   - Pros: Very safe, FDIC insured up to $250,000
   - Cons: Low interest rates
   - Alternative: Money Market Mutual Funds (e.g., VMFXX at 4.2%)

2. **Stocks and Bonds**
   - Pros: Better average returns, good liquidity
   - Cons: Variable returns, requires knowledge/luck
   - Can be held directly or through mutual funds

3. **Real Estate and Real Assets**
   - Pros: Consumption value, inflation protection
   - Cons: Low liquidity, maintenance costs

## 1.3 Basics of Equities (Stocks)

### 1.3.1 Stock Ownership
- Fractional ownership of publicly traded companies
- Example: Apple has 15.02 billion shares outstanding
- Market capitalization = shares outstanding × price per share

### 1.3.2 Market Capitalization
- Total market value of company's stock
- Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Debt - Cash
- Largest companies (as of April 2024):
  1. Apple/Microsoft (tied at $2.7 trillion)
  2. Nvidia
  3. Amazon
  4. Alphabet
  5. Saudi Aramco

### 1.3.3 Stock Pricing
- Determined by supply and demand
- Bid (highest buy offer) vs. Ask (lowest sell offer)
- Bid-ask spread affects trading costs
- Example: Tesla bid $227.90, ask $228.90 (0.4% spread)

### 1.3.4 Rate of Return Calculation
- Holding Period Return = ((P1 - P0) + Distributions)/P0
- P1 = End price, P0 = Start price
- Distributions = Dividends, spinouts
- Example: Apple dividend = $0.25/quarter

### 1.3.5 Financial Ratios

1. **Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**
   - Price per share ÷ Earnings per share
   - Market average: 15-16
   - Growth companies: Higher P/E
   - Example: Apple (26.94) vs. Nvidia (32.24)

2. **Other Important Ratios**
   - Market Cap to Sales
   - Operating Margin
   - Dividend Yield
   - Debt/Equity Ratio

## 1.4 Investment Philosophies

### 1.4.1 Growth vs. Value Investing
1. **Growth Investing**
   - High growth potential
   - High P/E ratios
   - Low/zero dividends
   - Example: Moderna, Nvidia, Uber

2. **Value Investing**
   - Low P/E ratios
   - High dividends
   - Out-of-favor stocks
   - Example: Ford, Intel, AT&T

## 1.5 Investment Risk

### 1.5.1 Types of Risk
1. **Systematic (Market) Risk**
   - Overall market performance
   - Economic conditions

2. **Non-systematic Risk**
   - Company-specific developments
   - Can be diversified away

3. **Interest Rate Risk**
   - Changes in interest rates
   - Affects bond prices

4. **Inflation Risk**
   - Purchasing power erosion
   - Investment growth vs. price increases

5. **Political Risk**
   - Country stability
   - Property rights

6. **Currency Risk**
   - Exchange rate fluctuations
   - International investments

7. **Credit Risk**
   - Borrower default
   - Bond investments

8. **Liquidity Risk**
   - Marketability of investments
   - Example: 2008 financial crisis

### 1.5.2 Portfolio Risk
- Focus on total portfolio risk
- Diversification reduces risk
- Correlation between assets matters
- Some assets can be added without increasing risk

## 1.6 Stock Market Mechanics

### 1.6.1 Stock Indices
1. **Dow Jones Industrial Average**
   - 30 stocks
   - Price-weighted
   - Longest history

2. **S&P 500**
   - 500 large-cap stocks
   - Market-cap weighted
   - Most widely followed

3. **Nasdaq**
   - Technology-focused
   - Market-cap weighted

4. **Russell 2000**
   - Small-cap stocks
   - Market-cap weighted

### 1.6.2 Stock Splits
1. **Regular Splits**
   - Example: 2-for-1 split
   - Doubles shares, halves price
   - No change in ownership percentage
   - Example: Chipotle 50-for-1 split

2. **Reverse Splits**
   - Combines shares
   - Increases price
   - Often follows poor performance
   - Example: GE 1-for-8 reverse split

### 1.6.3 Dividends
1. **Payment Process**
   - Quarterly payments
   - Ex-dividend date
   - Payable date
   - Stock price adjustment

2. **Dividend Policy**
   - Regular increases
   - Target payout ratios
   - Rare cuts (negative signal)
   - Range: <1% to ~10%

3. **Share Repurchases**
   - Alternative to dividends
   - Reduces shares outstanding
   - Increases EPS
   - More flexible than dividends
   - Example: S&P 500 companies repurchased $755B in 2023

## 1.7 Return Calculations

### 1.7.1 Steady vs. Fluctuating Returns
- Steady 9%: $10,000 → $56,044 in 20 years
- Fluctuating (±29%, -11%): $10,000 → $39,790
- Geometric mean < Arithmetic mean
- Example: 100% then -50% = 0% geometric return

## 1.8 Key Takeaways
1. Investment goals should be clear and prioritized
2. Understanding risk-return tradeoffs is crucial
3. Diversification reduces portfolio risk
4. Stock splits don't change fundamental value
5. Dividends and buybacks are ways companies return cash
6. Geometric returns are more important than arithmetic averages
7. Market indices track price changes, not total returns
