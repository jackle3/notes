# Bayes’ Theorem with Cards

- The probability of the opponent having a tell given that they have an ace is 0.5
    - $P(T|A) = 0.5$﻿
- The probability of them having a tell given they don’t have an ace is 0.1
    - $P(T|A^C) = 0.1$﻿

- We want to know the probability that they don’t have an ace given that they have no cell
    
    - If $P(A^c | T^c) > 0.5$﻿, then you should play
    
    $P(A^c|T^c) = \frac{P(T^c | A^c) P(A^c)}{P(T^c|A^c)P(A^c) + P(T^c|A)P(A)}$
    
    $P(A^c|T^c) = \frac{0.9 P(A^c)}{0.9P(A^c) + 0.5P(A)}$
    
- We now have to manually calculate $P(A)$﻿.
    
    $P(A^c) = \frac{41 \choose 2}{45 \choose 2}$
    
    - We want to choose two cards. We have already been shown 7 cards, so 45 cards are left.
    - Since none of the aces have been shown, 41 of the cards are not aces.
- Now we substitute it back in
    
    $P(A^c|T^c) = \frac{0.9 * 0.83}{0.9 * 0.83 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.83)}$
    
    - We have a 90% chance of winning this game, so we should play.

# Inclusion Exclusion

- Used when there exists outcomes that are shared between different events.

## Two Sets

$P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E\cap F)$

## Three Sets

# Independence

- Events are **independent** if knowing that event $B$﻿ happened doesn’t change our belief that $A$﻿ will happen.
    
    $P(A) = P(A | B)$
    
- Alternatively, you can use the chain rule.

- If two events are independent, their complements are also independent.

## Generalized Independence

# Generalized Chain Rule

- If events $A, B, C$﻿ are not independent, finding their probability is just the chain rule.

$P(ABC) = P(A) P(B|A) P(C|AB)$

- If we know that the events are independent, then it gets super easy!

$P(E) = P(X_1 \cup X_2 \cup \dots \cup X_n)$

- $X_i$﻿ is the event of path $i$﻿ functioning. They are not mutually exclusive, so it’s hard.
- There can be many paths existing. It is easier to find the complement, the probability that there does not exist a path from $A$﻿ to $B$﻿.
    
    $P(E) = 1 - P(X_1^c \cap X_2^c \dots)$
    
    $P(E) = 1 - (1-p_1)(1-p_2)\dots$
