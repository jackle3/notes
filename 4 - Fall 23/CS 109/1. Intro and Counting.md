# Neural Networks

## Neurons

- Takes in inputs, in the form of ones and zeros
- Then, each of those inputs are multiplied by their weights, producing a weighted sum.
- Then it goes through a squashing function, giving a prediction.

- It goes through multiple layers of this. The final layer is a single neuron, which is a number between 1 and 0. That is the probability.

# Counting

- **Experiments** in probability lead to an **outcome**.
- How many possible **outcomes** satisfy some **event**?

- With the experiment being a dice roll, there are six possible outcomes.
- When rolling two dice, there are 36 possible outcomes. It can be a tuple where the first number is the first dice, and the second is the second dice.

### Step Rule

- Also known as the **Product Rule of Counting**
- If an experiment has two steps, where
    - $|A|$﻿ is the number of outcomes from step 1,
    - $|B|$﻿ is the number of outcomes from step 2,
    - and B is unaffected by the outcome of the first step,
    - Then the number of outcomes of the experiment is $|A| * |B|$﻿
- Example:
    - If you had a picture with pixels, where each can be one of 17 million distinct colors,
    - Then there are $(17 \text{ million})^n$﻿ possible pictures, where $n$﻿ is the number of pixels.

### Sum Rule

### Example

- How many 6-bit strings are there that either start with “01” or end with “10”.
    - There are $2^4$﻿ possible strings starting with “01”, because the first two letters are locked and each of the remaining letters in the string has two choices.
    - There are also $2^4$﻿ ending with “10”.
    - However, you can’t just add them together because there are duplicates in the two sets.

- We found $|A \text{ and } B|$﻿ by locking the first two and last two letters, then doing $2^2$﻿ to find the possible outcomes.

### Or Rule of Counting (aka Inclusion / Exclusion)
