# Geometric random variable

![[attachments/Untitled 2 129.png|Untitled 2 129.png]]

- $X$﻿ is how many times you need to flip a coin until you get your first head
    - The values for $X$﻿ has to be discrete and nonzero. Can’t get the first head if you flip the coin zero times.

# Negative binomial random variable

![[attachments/Untitled 3 126.png|Untitled 3 126.png]]

- $P(X = n)$﻿ means what’s the probability that it took $n$﻿ flips to get $r$﻿ heads.
    - It must be true that $r \leq n$﻿
- The negative binomial is basically a sum of multiple geometric random variables.

# Matching random variables to scenarios

- Each person you date has a 0.2 probability of being someone you spend your life with. What is the average number of people one will date? What is the standard deviation?
    - This is a _geometric_ random variable problem:
        - Let $X$﻿ be the number of people until you find the one.
        - $X \sim \text{Geo}(p=0.2)$﻿
    - The average number of people one will date is $E[X] = 1/p = 5$﻿
    - The standard deviation is $\sqrt{\text{Var}(X)} = \sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p^2}}$﻿

## Bitcoin mining

- Every bit in the final bit string is now a coin flip between 1 and 0.
- Each digit in the bit string is independent. Getting a number starting with $g$﻿ zeroes is just getting a zero, followed by another zero, etc.
- Note that $P(X = g) = P(X = 0)$﻿

- The probability of getting a single bitcoin is $p_a$﻿. We are interested about the number of trials required to get 2 bitcoins.
- Alternatively, you can also say:
    - Let $X$﻿ be the number of bit coins mined in the first $99$﻿ trials.
    - We declare $X \sim \text{Bin}(n=99, p=p_a)$﻿
        - In other words, we want to count the number of bitcoins we can get, given that there is a $p_a$﻿ probability of getting a bitcoin.
    - We want to find $P(X \geq 2)$﻿, since we want to know what the chance of getting 2 or more bitcoins is in 99 trials.
        - Solution is $1 - \Big( P(X=0) + P(x=1) \Big)$﻿

# Continuous values

- `random()` is a continous number between 0 and 1.
    - It’s hard to find the probability of getting an exact number, especially if we go to infinite decimal points.
- As another example, time is continuous.

## Bus example

![[attachments/Untitled 8 106.png|Untitled 8 106.png]]

- Suppose we break up that 5 minute time period between 2:15pm and 2:20pm into an infinite number of chunks.
    - This probability is the integral of this section of the probability density function.
    - This new curve is the derivative of the probability.

# Probability density function

## Properties of PDFs

- A definite integral asks what is the probability that the random variable $X$﻿ takes on a value between $a$﻿ and $b$﻿.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 11 93.png|Untitled 11 93.png]]
    
- Since it’s a probability, the sum over the entire density function should be 1.
    
    - $f(x)$﻿ itself can be greater than 1, but the integral has to be less than or equal to 1.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 12 90.png|Untitled 12 90.png]]
    
- Integrating a probability density function gives you a _probability_.
    - For any exact point on the PDF, the probability is zero. We only get a non-zero probability when we look at intervals or ranges.

## Reading PDFS

- Remember that PDFs are graphs of the derivative of the probability.
    - The value of the derivative basically tells you how much you contribute to the total area, which is the probability.
- In the graphs below, `x=0` means it’s closer to 2pm, and `x=60` means it’s closer to 3pm.

![[attachments/Untitled 13 84.png|Untitled 13 84.png]]

- Peaks on the PDF indicate that values at that area are more likely.
    - Graph A says that the arrival time is more likely to be 3pm.
    - Graph B says the arrival time is constant during the time span.
    - Graph C says its more likely that the arrival time is around 2:15pm.

# Uniform Random Variable

![[attachments/Untitled 15 70.png|Untitled 15 70.png]]

- `random()` is a uniform random variable, with $\alpha = 0$﻿ and $\beta = 1$﻿

## Example

# Exponential Random Variable

- This is the continous form of the Poisson.
- It concerns the question: What is the amount of time until the next success?

![[attachments/Untitled 17 61.png|Untitled 17 61.png]]

- The process for an Exponential and a Poisson are the same.
    - So is the parameter $\lambda$﻿. The only thing different is what we are asking.
        - The Poisson asks for the number of success in an interval of time.
        - The Exponential asks for the **time until** first success.
- Exponential is **memoryless.** It does not care how much time has already passed.

# Cumulative Density Function

![[attachments/Untitled 22 39.png|Untitled 22 39.png]]

- Inputting $F(5)$﻿ asks what is the probability that the random variable is less than $5$﻿.

## CDF of an Exponential RV

![[attachments/Untitled 23 36.png|Untitled 23 36.png]]

- The CDF gives us a close form equation of the integral of the random variable.

## Calculating P(X > x)

- To do this, we can take the complement of the CDF.
- To find the probability of $P(X > 1)$﻿, we find $1 - F(1)$﻿.

## Calculating $P(x1 < X < x2)$﻿

- We can take two CDFS to calculate this.
- The answer is $F(x2) - F(x1)$﻿,
