- A **random number** is a number which takes on values probabilisitcally
- A _discrete_ random variable is fully descrbed by a probability mass function.
- We can calculate **summary statistics** such as expectation and variance.

# Expectation from data

- The expectation from a dataset is just the average of the values.

- Multiple $x$﻿ by the number of times it shows up is basically just like summing over all the values and counting them once.

# Binomial

${n \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$

- If we declare $X$﻿ to be a binomial random variable, we automatically know this PMF:

- Suppose we have a binomial random variable $H$﻿ and we want to find $P(H<10)$﻿.
    - Notice that each $H = i$﻿ is mutually exclusive since we can’t have both 0 successes and 9 successes at the same time.
    - As such, the solution is just $\sum_{x=0}^9P(H=x)$﻿
        - There’s no shorter way to do this :/

## Games example

- Technically they stop playing after 4 wins. However, we count all 7 because it makes each set of games mutually exclusive.

# Bernoulli Random Variable

- This is a binomial random variable where $n = 1$﻿.
    - The experiment either results in a single success or failure

- The bernoulli random variable is an indicator random variable.
- The binomial random variable is a sum of $n$﻿ Bernoulli random variables.

# Expectation of binomial random variables

![Untitled 9 107.png](attachments/Untitled%209%20107.png)

- $X$﻿ is just the sum of multiple bernoulli random variables $Y$﻿

# Variance

- The variance is the expected value of the different of the random variable from the expected value of the variable.

$\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2] = E[(X - \mu)^2]$

- Remember that in data points, the expected value is just the mean

# Standard Deviation

- The standard deviation is the square root of the variance
