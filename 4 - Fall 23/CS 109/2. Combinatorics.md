# Permutations

- How many letter orderings are possible for the word **CHRIS**?

![[attachments/Untitled 1 144.png|Untitled 1 144.png]]

- A **permutation** is an **ordered** arrangement of objects.
- The number of permutations of n **distinct** objects is $n!$﻿

- Since there are six smudges on six numbers, the passwords must be distinct.
- There are $6! = 720$﻿ passcodes. The first digit has 6 options, the second has 5 options, etc…

## Sorting Distinct Objects

## Sorting Semi-Distinct Objects

![[attachments/Untitled 4 135.png|Untitled 4 135.png]]

- If we suppose all objects were distinct, it would be calculated as the permutations considering some objects are indistinct multiplied by the permutations of the indistinct objects.
    - The indistinct objects can be rearranged.

## Counting Permutations

- Consider the word `BOBA`. There are `4` objects, but `2` are the same. As such, the calculation is $4! / 2! = 12$﻿ permutations.

## Example

- Think of the problem in steps.
- In the first step, we choose what digit is the one being repeated.
    - There are 5 possible digits we can choose.
- In the second step, we find the number of unique passcodes assuming the digit we chose is the one repeating.
    - There are 6 digits, and 2 of them are indistinct. We find the number of permutations of this.

# Combinations

- Suppose there are $n = 20$﻿ people.
- How many ways can be **choose** $k = 5$﻿ people to get cake?
    - Key idea: it does not matter the order in which people get cake.
- Story:
    1. Suppose we put the $n$﻿ people in a line. We know that there are $n!$﻿ ways to order these people.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 8 118.png|Untitled 8 118.png]]
        
    2. We put the first $k$﻿ people in a cake room. There is 1 way to do this.

    3. Note that there are $k!$﻿ different permutations that would’ve led to the same cake group. These first $k$﻿ people could be ordered in any way within the first group, and still be led to the cake room.

    4. With the remaining people, there are $(n-k)!$﻿ different permutations for the people not in the cake room. They can be ordered in any way, as long as they aren’t in the first $k$﻿ people.

# Buckets and the Divider Method

- How many ways are there to put $n$﻿ things into $r$﻿ buckets?

![[attachments/Untitled 14 84.png|Untitled 14 84.png]]

- There are $r$﻿ ways to put the 1st string, then $r$﻿ ways to put the 2nd string, and more.
    - With $n$﻿ strings, this means that there would be $r^n$﻿ outcomes.

## Divider Method

- Think of number of permutations for the objects as well as dividers.
    - If there are $n$﻿ items and $3$﻿ buckets, find the number of permutations of $n$﻿ items and $2$﻿ dividers, where the items can be duplicates and the dividers are duplicated.

- Think of the following steps.
    1. Think of all the people and dividers as being distinct.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 17 69.png|Untitled 17 69.png]]
        
    2. Order $n$﻿ distinct objects and $r-1$﻿ distinct dividers.
        1. This is just $(n+r-1)!$﻿
    3. Now make the $n$﻿ objects indistinct.
        1. We would divide by $n!$﻿
    4. Now make the $r-1$﻿ dividers indistict.
        1. Divide by $(r-1)!$﻿

## Example

![[attachments/Untitled 19 56.png|Untitled 19 56.png]]

- We can think of each $x_i$﻿ as the number of objects inside a box, with there being $r$﻿ boxes. Essentially, there are $n$﻿ objects and $r$﻿ boxes.
- The solution is just simply the solution for the basic stars and bars method above.
