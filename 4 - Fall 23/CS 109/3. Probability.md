# PSET Example Answer

# Counting and Probability

![[attachments/Untitled 1 127.png|Untitled 1 127.png]]

- The distinct parts of the counting rules are important for probability.

## Counting Example

![[attachments/Untitled 2 126.png|Untitled 2 126.png]]

- There are $n$﻿ choose $2$﻿ distinct pairs of animals. We just pick two animals. The order does not matter, and the order we choose the animals does not matter.

![[attachments/Untitled 3 123.png|Untitled 3 123.png]]

- This is the same counting the number of squares in the upper right triangle in red.
    - The number of squares here is $(n-1) + (n-2) + \dots + 2 + 1$﻿ = $(n-1)(n) / 2$﻿
    - The combinations formula is $n!/(2! * (n - 2)! = n(n-1)/2$﻿

# Spaces

## Sample Space

- The sample space $S$﻿ is a set of all possible outcomes of an experiment

![[attachments/Untitled 4 118.png|Untitled 4 118.png]]

- The sample space does not have to be finite. It can be infinitely large.
- The sample space can also be real numbered. It does not necessarily have to be discrete.

## Event Space

- The event space $E$﻿ is some subset of $S$﻿ ($E \subseteq S$﻿)

![[attachments/Untitled 5 116.png|Untitled 5 116.png]]

- It’s the set of outcomes that satisfy some event.

## Summary

![[attachments/Untitled 6 114.png|Untitled 6 114.png]]

- Sample space is all the outcomes of an experiment
- The event space is the set of outcomes in the sample space that satisfy some event

# Probability

- A probability is a number between 0 and 1
- It’s a number that we ascribe meaning to → $P(E)$﻿ is the probability of event $E$﻿ occuring

![[attachments/Untitled 7 111.png|Untitled 7 111.png]]

- Imagine you run an infinite number of experiments. The probability is the ratio between the number of trials where the event occurs $n(E)$﻿ and the total number of trials $n$﻿.

## Axioms of Probability

![[attachments/Untitled 8 103.png|Untitled 8 103.png]]

![[attachments/Untitled 9 99.png|Untitled 9 99.png]]

- Axiom 1 says every probability is a number between 0 and 1
- Axiom 2 says that the probability of some outcome happening is 1. Some outcome will always happen.
- Identity 3 says that the probability of $E$﻿ not happening is $1 - P(E)$﻿.
    - The $c$﻿ denotes complement of the event.

## Equally Likely Outcomes

- A special case where probability can be easily derived from counting

![[attachments/Untitled 10 94.png|Untitled 10 94.png]]

- For example, the probability of flipping two coins and getting heads first is $2/4$﻿.
    - $E = \{\{H, H\}, \{H, T\}\}$﻿
- However, note that not everything is equally likely.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 11 91.png|Untitled 11 91.png]]
    
    - This is obviously wrong. The outcomes are not equally likely.

### Sum of two dice

![[attachments/Untitled 12 88.png|Untitled 12 88.png]]

- All the outcomes here are equally likely, because all the outcomes of each dice roll is equally likely.

## Other ways to make sample space

- There are multiple ways to express the sample space for a certain experiment.
- However, be careful of whether the sample space is actually useful for the problem.

![[attachments/Untitled 13 82.png|Untitled 13 82.png]]

- For the second option, it creates a sample space where the outcomes are not equally likely.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 14 71.png|Untitled 14 71.png]]
    
    - In the real world, the chance of getting $(1, 1)$﻿ is half as likely as getting a $(1, 2)$﻿
        - Because we could have dice1 = 1 and dice2 = 2, or vice versa.
        - However in this sample space since we make the dice indistinct, we lose that.
- Same issue for the third option. The outcomes are not equally likely.

# Cows and Pigs Example

![[attachments/Untitled 16 64.png|Untitled 16 64.png]]

- There are multiple sample spaces we can pick in this case

![[attachments/Untitled 17 60.png|Untitled 17 60.png]]

- We can consider our choices as ordered or unordered, and we can think of the cows and pigs as distinct or indistinct.
- For the indistinct unordered sample space:
    - Two possible outcomes in this space are $\{3 \text{ cows}\}$﻿ and $\{3 \text{ pigs}\}$﻿. However, it is more likely that you get three cows than it is to get three pigs.
- For the indistinct ordered sample space:
    - Two possible outcomes are `[cow, cow, cow]` and `[pig, pig, pig]`. However, they are also not equally likely.
- For the distinct unordered sample space:
    - There are 7 choose 3 possible outcomes in this case. You have 7 animals, and you just choose three animals.
    - The event space is the number of ways to pick the cows and the number of ways to pick the pigs.
- For the distinct ordered sample space:
    - There are 210 outcomes in the sample space, since you are picking three arbitrary animals.
    - For the event space, the first is picking a pig first, then cows for the rest. The second is picking a cow first, then pig, then another cow. Finally, it’s picking two cows then a pig.

![[attachments/Untitled 18 54.png|Untitled 18 54.png]]

- Since we are drawing things, for every unordered outcome, there are $3!$﻿ ordered outcomes.

## Key Idea of Sample Space Outcomes

- Make indistinct items **distinct** to get equally likely sample space outcomes

# Straight Poker Hand Example

- Consider 5 card poker hands. What is the probability of getting a straight?
    - A straight is 5 consecutive cards of any suit.
- Sample space is 52 choose 5.
- We construct event space by steps:
    - We first pick a card for our first card. There are 10 choices for the first card.
    - We then have to choose the suit for each card. Since the suit does not matter, it can be any suit.
    - Our event space is $10 * 4 * 4 * 4* 4 * 4$﻿. There are 10 choices for our first card, and 4 choices of suit for each card.

![[attachments/Untitled 19 48.png|Untitled 19 48.png]]

![[attachments/Untitled 20 47.png|Untitled 20 47.png]]

- For the straight flush, it’s just $10 * 4$﻿. We choose our first value, then we choose a single suit.

## Key Idea for Equally Likely

- When approaching an “equally likely probability” problem, start by defining sample spaces and event spaces.

# Chip Defect Detection Example

![[attachments/Untitled 21 42.png|Untitled 21 42.png]]

- Sample space is $n$﻿ choose $k$﻿.
- How many chips bags have no defects?
    - (n-1) choose k
- Event space is the outcomes that have the defective chip.
    - The first step is to choose $k-1$﻿ non-defective chips.
        - Since 1 chip is defective, there are $n-1$﻿ non-defective chips. As such, there are $(n-1)$﻿ choose $(k-1)$﻿ non-defective chips.
    - The second step is to choose our defective chip. This is 1 choose 1.

# Target Example

![[attachments/Untitled 23 35.png|Untitled 23 35.png]]

# Complement

![[attachments/Untitled 24 32.png|Untitled 24 32.png]]

- One way to approach this problem is to directly count all ways you see 1 or more friends.
    - That is hard. You would have to count the ways you could see exactly one friend, then exactly two friends and so on.
- It is much easier to calculate the ways that you see zero friends.
    - If we can calculate the probability of seeing zero friends our answer is just one minus that number.

![[attachments/Untitled 25 29.png|Untitled 25 29.png]]

- The probability of not seeing any friends is choosing $s$﻿ people from people you are not friends with.

## Key Idea with Complement

- Many times it is easier to calculate $P(E^C)$
