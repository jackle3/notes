# Probability Density Function

![[attachments/Untitled 170.png|Untitled 170.png]]

- The probability of a random variable taking on a real-valued number doesn’t make much sense, since there is infinite decimal precision.
- To do this, we assume the problem is discrete. Then, we continously break it up into smaller and smaller chunks.

# Normal Random Variable

- The normal random variable is defined by the mean and the variance, and it’s in the shape of a bell curve.
    - The mean tells us where the middle of the curve is, and the variances specifies how wide the curve is.

- The support is -infinity to infinity, so we can basically ask a probability question about any value assignment to $X$﻿.

- Many things in nature are gaussian (normally distributed). This is because Gaussian is a pretty reasonable assumption for many probability cases.
    - A Gaussian makes the fewest assumptions after matching mean and variance.

- This new equation is proportional because the $\sqrt{2 \pi}$﻿ was just a constant.
- Taking a log of this expression gives us a clean expression since the exp cancels out.

## Linear transformation is still normal

## Standard Normal

- A normal distribution with mean of zero and a variance of 1.
- There is a special linear transformation that turns any normal random variable to one with mean zero and variance of 1.

## Phi

- This is a lookup table for the CDF of just the **standard normal** distribution.

![[attachments/Untitled 11 96.png|Untitled 11 96.png]]

- Note that Phi is an invertible function. You can do $\phi^{-1}(p) = x$﻿

### Symmetry of Phi

$\phi(-a) = 1 - \phi(a)$

### Interval of Phi

## Computing the CDF by transforming Phi

![[attachments/Untitled 14 76.png|Untitled 14 76.png]]

- Remember that $Z$﻿ is the transformation that turns any normal random variable to the standard normal.

## CDF Summary

- Calculating the CDF of any normal random variable is done through Phi transform.

- Use `stats.norm.cdf(x, mean, std)` to calculate it in code

## Example

# Bikes example

- Remember that we can’t integrate this expression. Therefore, we use the phi table.

# More examples

- Let $X \sim N(\mu = 3, \sigma^2 = 16)$﻿
- Negative example:

$P(X > 0) = 1 - P(X < 0) \\= 1 - \phi(\frac{0 - 3}{4}) \\= 1 - \phi(-3/4) \\$

- Interval example:

$P(2 < X < 5) = P(X < 5) - P(X < 2)$

- Absolute value example:

$P(|X-3| > 6) = P(X > 9) + P(X <-3)$

## Continuity correction

- The example above is missing **continuity correction**

- We were supposed to get the whole 65 rectangle. However, since we used the normal distribution, we kind of chopped that rectangle in half.
    - To fix this, we shift the line back half a step to consider the whole thing.

# Normal vs Poisson Approximation

![[attachments/Untitled 23 38.png|Untitled 23 38.png]]

## Example

![[attachments/Untitled 24 34.png|Untitled 24 34.png]]

# Normal Distribution Example

- $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$﻿
- $P(X < x) = \Phi(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})$﻿

- We have $k$﻿ computers, and we have $r$﻿ requests. Note that $r = 10000k$﻿ because every computer can handle 10000 requests..
- $P(R < r) = P(\text{no drop})$﻿
- To solve this, we can use the inverse Phi function. We pass in the probability, and we get the input that leads to that probability.
