# Sampling

![[attachments/Untitled 173.png|Untitled 173.png]]

- We can say that each of these random variables is a sample from the distribution.
    - This is because they all have the same distribution, and they are independent.

# Population Statistics

- Since we only have 200 samples, we have to find the best estimate of the population statistics using our samples.

# Estimating Population Mean

- To estimate it, we can just use our formula for the mean of IIDs

- To check whether the estimate is good, we need to check if the expectation of our estimate is the same as the actual mean.

- **Unbiased estimator** - when the expectation of a statistic lines up exactly with the true parameter

- Note that $\bar{X}$﻿ is also a random variable. It’s variance can be estimated.

# Estimating Population Variance

- We need by $n-1$﻿ because we are estimating the variance using $\bar{X}$﻿, which it itself an estimate.

- $S^2$﻿ is an **unbiased estimator** of the population variance because $E[S^2] = \sigma^2$﻿

# Standard error of the mean

- This is basically like the error bars in our estimate. For example, when we say our estimate for the population mean is $83 \pm 2$﻿, the standard error of the mean is $2$﻿.
- We find this using the **variance of the sample mean** (not the same as the variance of the sample)

- The true value of $\text{Var}(\bar{X})$﻿ is $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$﻿. However, we don’t know $\sigma$﻿, so we have to estimate it.

$\text{Standard error} = \text{Std}(\bar{X}) = \sqrt{\text{Var}(\bar{X})} = \sqrt{\frac{S^2}{n}}$
