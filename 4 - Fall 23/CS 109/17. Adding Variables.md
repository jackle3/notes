# IID Random Variables

- Short for independent and identically distributed RVs

![Untitled 188.png](../../attachments/Untitled%20188.png)

- It is important to note that they must all be independent.

# Motivating Examples

## Zero Sum Games

- Remember back to the example with the warriors and whether they would win or not.

    - We couldn’t analytically solve this back then since we didn’t know how to compare the two random variables. We had to sample.
- Now, we can use the idea of adding random variables to solve this

## Sum of Dice

- Each $X_i$﻿ is IID because dice are independent and have the same distribution.

# Adding Random Variables

- When we add random variables, we get another random variable.
- **Convolution**: basically a synonym for adding random variables

## General Formula

# Sum of Independent Binomials

# Sum of Independent Normals

# Sum of Independent Poissons

# Virus Infections Example

![Untitled 11 112.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%20112.png)

- There are many approaches for this problem.
    - We can use the general formula for adding RVs with the original binomials.
    - We can also approximate it as normals, which is what we did above.

# Sum of Independent Uniforms

![Untitled 12 109.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%20109.png)

- Using the general formula for adding RVs, we have the following
    
    ![Untitled 13 101.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%20101.png)
    
    - Notice that the bounds is 0 to 0.2, because if we went past that then $f(Y=0.2-i)$﻿ becomes invalid.
    - In addition, the answer to that integral is just $0.2$﻿ because both the PDF equations are just equal to 1.

## General Formula for two RVs

![Untitled 14 89.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2014%2089.png)

- In the example above, $X$﻿ and $Y$﻿ are independent and identically distributed.

# Central Limit Theorem

- Sum of $n$﻿ IDD random variables is a normal with
    - Mean $n \times E[X_i]$﻿
    - Variance $n\times\text{Var}(X_i)$﻿
- This theorem applies to any type of random variable.

- This is why the binomial PMF looks like a Gaussian distribution: it’s just equal to a sum of Bernoulli random variables.

# Mean of IID Random Varibles

![Untitled 22 47.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2022%2047.png)

- By the CLT, the mean of IID are distributed normally.

# Runtime Example

- We want to estimate the average running time for a program
    
    ![Untitled 24 40.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2024%2040.png)
    
- We can use the mean of the trials as our estimate. In this case, the mean is normally distributed.
- This problem wants us to find $n$﻿ such that the difference between our estimate $\bar{X}$﻿ and the actual time $t$﻿ is within $0.5$﻿, with a 95% certainty.

![Untitled 26 30.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2026%2030.png)

- Notice that $\bar{X} - t$﻿ only changes the mean, not the variance. This is because $t$﻿ is not a random variable. We’re just shifting the center of $\bar{X}$
