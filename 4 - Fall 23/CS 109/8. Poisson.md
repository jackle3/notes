# Poisson Random Variable

- The number of occurrences of a certain event in a fixed interval of time.

- $X$﻿ can take on values from 0 up to infinity.c

## Example and derivation

- Suppose we want to find the probability of $k$﻿ requests from a certain area in 1 minute.
- We know that on average, there are 5 requests per minute.
- We can break this problem into a binomial problem, where each second is one independent trial of getting a request or not getting a request.

- If we want more detail, we can break it into milliseconds.

- We can go even further and break it into infinitely small buckets.

- Solving this limit gets us the equation of the Poisson PMF

    - As $n$﻿ goes to infinity, the denominator $\lambda /n$﻿ approaches zero. Therefore, the whole denominator $(1 - \lambda / n)^k$﻿ approaches 1. The numerator is the definition of the natural exponent.
    - As $n$﻿ approaches infinity, $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$﻿ looks more and more like $n^k$﻿.

## Earthquakes example

- Suppose there is an average of $2.73$﻿ major earthquakes per year. What is the probability of $3$﻿ major earthquakes next year?

# Approximate binomial with poison

- If the $n \choose k$﻿ term in the binomial gets really big, we can approximate the binomial with the poisson.

## DNA example

- With the large value of $n$﻿, calculating this binomial can be very difficult.

- Before, we chose $p = \lambda / n$﻿. Using this, we can get our value of $\lambda$﻿, which is the expected number of occurences.
