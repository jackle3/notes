- $P(E \cup E^C)$﻿ means the probability of $E$﻿ happening or $E$﻿ not happening.
    - That’s just equal to every outcome possible, so the probability is $1$﻿.

# Conditional Probability

## Example

![Untitled 4 123.png](../../attachments/Untitled%204%20123.png)

- On the right side, it’s asking what is the probability of getting a sum of $4$﻿ if the first dice observed was $2$﻿.

- We basically enter the world where $F$﻿ has already occurred.

# Chain Rule

![Untitled 11 95.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%2095.png)

- The probability that the baby has pooped and cries is $P(EF) = P(F)P(E | F) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25$﻿

# Bayes’ Theorem

![Untitled 20 49.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2020%2049.png)

- $P(EF) = P(E|F) \times P(F)$﻿
- Reversing the def. of conditional prob, we also have $P(EF) = P(F|E) \times P(E)$﻿.

## Spam Email Example

![Untitled 22 40.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2022%2040.png)

- We can get $P(E)$﻿ from the Law of Total Probability.
    
    - $P(E) = P(E|F)P(F) + P(E|F^C)P(F^C)$﻿
    

## Virus Testing Example

![Untitled 23 37.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2023%2037.png)

- What is the probability that you have SARS given that you test positive?
    - We know the probability of testing positive given that you have SARS → 98%
    - We know the probability of testing positive given that you don’t have SARS → 1%
    - We know the probability of having SARS → 0.5%
    - We know the probability of not having SARS → 99.5%

![Untitled 24 33.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2024%2033.png)

![Untitled 25 30.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2025%2030.png)

![Untitled 26 26.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2026%2026.png)

- We have a 1% false positive rate, so 10 out of 1000 people test positive but do not have SARS. There are also 0.5% of people with SARS. Putting these together, you can see that the percentage of testing positive and having SARS is not much.
- What is the probability that you have SARS given that you tested negative?

# Bayes’ Theorem and Location

![Untitled 28 22.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2028%2022.png)

- The grid on the left gives us the observations at different locations. This means that we know the probability of an observation given the location we are at.
    - In math terms, we know $P(O|L_i)$﻿
- Now suppose we have an observation. What is the probability of some location given an observation?

    - The denominator is an application of the law of total probability, where each of the 9 possible outcomes are summed over.
