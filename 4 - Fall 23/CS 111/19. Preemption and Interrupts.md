# Timer

- **Interrupts:** something at the OS level, pauses the code currently running on a core and lets another piece of code run.
- **Preemption:** interrupting a thread and putting another thread on → threads can be kicked off in favor of others
    - Usually implemented using a timer. The timer fires at a specified interval, and it triggers a context switch.

## Demo

- This isn’t multithreading. The thread still runs in main.
- Every half a second, the timer triggers.
    - This pauses the code in main, then runs the `timer_interrupt_handler`, then it goes back and continues running main.

## Interrupts

- When the timer is running the `timer_interrupt_handler`, it disables interrupts so it doesn’t interrupt itself.

- We have to properly disable and enable interrupts for context switching to work.
- The interrupt state is global → shared between all threads

## Context Switch

- Since the context switch is **inside** the timer code, the thread that we are switching away from _disables_ interrupts, and the thread we are switching to _enables_ interrupts.

    - Assuming that both threads have ran before, thread \#2 is at the context switch line inside the timer.
    - When thread 1 enters the timer handler, it disables interrupts.
    - When it switches and thread 2 continues executing, it will enable interrupts once it finishes it’s own timer handler.
- When we context switch and start executing another thread for the **first time**, it won’t reenable interrupts!

    - When thread 1 context switches, it goes into the main function of thread 2 since that is where it starts.
    - However, since thread 1 disabled interrupts and thread 2 didn’t turn it back on, thread 2 will never reach it’s own handler.

## Manually enabling interrupt

- To fix, **manually enable** interrupts when a thread is first run.
- Here is the main function. notice that the `other_thread` runs `other_func`

- Here is other_func, which manually enables interrupts

## Summary

- Basically, if the freeze frame of the other thread isn’t in the handler, the interrupts will stay disabled when you switch into that thread.
