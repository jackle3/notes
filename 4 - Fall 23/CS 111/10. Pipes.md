# Pipeline

- Allows you to chain the output (STDOUT) of one command to be the input (STDIN) of another command → each command doesn’t need to know it’s part of a pipeline.
- For example, `sort Makefile | tail` sorts the Makefile, and then returns the 10 last lines from that file.
    - If we had a list of names, it would return the 10 lowest names in alphabetical order.

# Implementation of shell pipelines

- For two-command pipelines, the process is:
    
    1. Spawn 2 child processes (1 per command)
    2. Create a “magic portal” that allows data to be sent between two processes
        1. We create the magic portal using `pipe()`
        2. We share the magic portal between processes by relying on the cloning that happens in `fork()`, and a property of `execvp`.
        3. We connect a process’s STDIN/STDOUT to this portal using `dup2()`
    3. Connect one end of the portal to the first child’s `STDOUT`, and the other end to the second child’s `STDIN`

- Each process is running in parallel. Each program runs at the same time, and runs in parallel as soon as it is given input from preceding programs.
    - `sleep 3 | sleep 3` finished in 3 seconds, not 6 seconds.

# pipe() and fork()

- Fle descriptors are duplicated on `fork()`
- A `pipe` created prior to `fork()` will also be accessible in the child, because its file descriptors are duplicated.

## File descriptor table

- This open file table is shared between everyone. The file desciptor table is specific to each process, and stores pointers to the open file table.

## Reference count

- If a process opens a file then spawns a child process, both the parent and the child have to close the file.

- If a process spawns a child then opens a file, only the parent has access to that file.
    
    - **If you want a child to have access to a pipe, make it before you fork.**

    - The parent and the child each have their own open file table entry for that same file.

## Reading from pipe

- We read blocks until there are zero bytes available, or the end of the file has been reached.
    - In pipe, means all pipe write ends are closed, so nothing else can be written to it.
- The parent and the child share the same open file table entry for the pipe.
    
    - They both have to close both ends of the pipe when they’re done.

- If you try to read from a pipe and no data has been written, it will **block** until some data is available (or the pipe write end is closed everywhere).

# Key takeaways of open file table

- When we fork off a child process, the child process gets _shallow_ copies of all parent file descriptors.
    - It copies the file descriptor numbers, but not a copy of the actual file or pipe.
        - The file descriptors point to the same open file table entry.
    - Means that parent and child can share same pipe, and that the same cursor while reading the file can be advanced by both.
    - We need to close duplicated file descriptors in both the parent and the child.
- There is one open file table entry per **session**, not per file.
    - If you open a file twice in a single process, each has their own respective cursor.
