# Ordered writes

- Prevent certain kinds of inconsistencies by making updates **in a particular order**. In some situations, force synchronous writes to ensure a particular order.
    - E.g. adding block to file:
        - First remove from the free list, then write to the inode.
    - E.g. removing block from file:
        - First remove from the inode, then add onto the free list.
    - Thus we could never have a block in both the free list and an inode.
        - You want to minimize the possibility of a block being used by two different inodes.
    - However, **we could leak disk blocks.**
        - For example if we crash after removing from free list, the block is lost forever.
        - That’s better than having the block be used more than once though.
- **General rules**
    - Always initialize target before initializing new reference
        - E.g. if we are making a new file and adding it to the directory, we should initialize inode first before adding a new reference (directory entry) to it
    - Remove all existing references to a resource (inode, disk block, etc) before reusing it
        - E.g. remove all references to a block before adding the block to free list
    - Set a new reference before clearing the last reference to a live resource, to preserve data so you don’t lose it
        - E.g. moving a file from one directory to another → you should add the file to the new directory first, before removing it from the old directory
            - There will be two references, but that’s better than having no references to file.
- **This eliminates the need to wait for fsck on reboot**

## Downsides

- Instead of doing the write instantly, it just makes a note of the order of operations of what it’s supposed to do.
- In the example above, the block cache now remembers that before writing the inode to the disk, it needs to update the free list first.
    - In order to write block C to disk, it must first write block B to disk, etc

# Write-ahead logging (journaling)

![[attachments/Untitled 3 107.png|Untitled 3 107.png]]

- Write all operations into the log first, then write the log to the disk first, then do the operation itself.
- The log is always the source of truth of what the disk should contain.
- The log only adds. It does not change or delete previous entries in the log.

- We make a tradeoff between logging data and cost. Only log metadata operations, and don’t log payload data.

## Log operations

- There are operations such as `LogBlockAlloc` and `LogPatch`
- This log is marking block `1027` as being used. It removes that block from the free list.

- This log is changing the metadata → putting some new bytes in some new location. It goes to block number `8` on disk, then going to `136` bytes into the block, then putting bytes `0304` in that location.

    - The line below is the human-readable translation of the log. We are changing the first `i_addr` block number in inode 52 to block number 1035.

## Issues with logging

- Once portions of the log are no longer needed, we can make a checkpoint and truncate the log to just start from the checkpoint.

- An operation can require multiple metadata changes, which creates multiple log entries.

    - **Transactions** → group log entries together that need to be done together, all or none.
        - Only replay transactions that are fully completed; don’t do partial transactions.
- Running a log entry multiple times should have the same effect.

- Build up the log. Once a block cache block is written, we then write the relevant log entries first then write the block.

- Logging does not guarantee **durability** (data will be preserved), but it guarantees **consistency** (state is consistent).
