# Processes

- A **program** is a code you write to execute tasks
- A **process** is an instance of your _program_ running; consists of program and execution state.
    
    - You can have multiple processes that run the same program
    - Each process has its own identifier, known as the PID

# Multiprocessing

- The computer runs many processes simultaneously - even with just 1 core
    - "simultaneously" = switch between them so fast humans don't notice
        - Your program thinks it's the only thing running
    - OS schedules tasks - who gets to run when
    - Each gets a little time, then has to wait
        - Many times, waiting is good! E.g. waiting for key press, waiting for disk
    - Caveat: multicore computers can truly multitask

- When you run `ls` in the myth machines, it spawns a new process and runs the `ls` program inside that process.
- `pid_t` is the data type used to store PIDs

# fork()

![Untitled 2 101.png](../../attachments/Untitled%202%20101.png)

- A **system call** that creates a second process which is a _clone_ of the first.
    - Runs the second program at the exact same place.

        - Notice that the highlighted “Hello, world” line will not run, since it copies it and runs it from it’s current location.
- The operating system decides which process is ran. However, it is not deterministic.

## Terminology

- The **parent** is the original process, and the **child** is the new process that is forked off
    - Everything is duplicated in the child process (except PIDs are different).
        - File descriptors are the same
        - Memory regions (address spaces) like stack, heap are copied
- The child **starts** execution on the next program instruction. The parent **continues** execution with the next program instruction.
    - The order of which process is ran is up to the OS
- **fork()** is called once, but returns twice.
    
    - The parent calls **fork()** once, but both the parent and the child returns, so it returns twice.

- The child can also later call **fork**, thus becoming a parent of another child

## Differentiating parent and child

- The return value of `fork()` is different in the parent and the child
    
    ![Untitled 5 96.png](../../attachments/Untitled%205%2096.png)
    
    - If the child wants to get its own PID, it should use `getPID`
    
    ![Untitled 6 95.png](../../attachments/Untitled%206%2095.png)
    
    - Note that _whoever_ calls fork gets the PID number, while the other one gets 0.
        - If the child here later calls fork to spawn another child, it would get a PID number back, and the other child would get 0

## Summary of fork details

## Shell

- The shell works using `fork` — the shell (parent) forks off child process to run a command you enter. When you run a command, its parent is the shell.

![Untitled 8 86.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2086.png)

- The parent of the parent process is the shell.
    - `29351` is the PID of the shell that we are running this in
    - `29686` is the PID of the program that I am currently runnin
    - `29687` and `29688` is the PID of the child process that was forked.

## Fork example

![Untitled 9 82.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2082.png)

# Cloning process

- In this example, we make the parent and the child do different things.

## Virtual memory

- Notice that both processes are using the same memory address for the final string, but they each contain different string.
    
    ![Untitled 11 75.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%2075.png)
    
- Each program thinks it is given all memory addresses to use
- The operating system maps these virtual addresses to physical addresses
    - When a process forks, its virtual address space stays the same
    - The operating system will map the child's virtual addresses to **different** physical addresses than for the parent

## Lazy cloning

- The operating system only **lazily** makes copies.
    - It will have them **share physical addresses** until one of them **changes** its  
        memory contents to be different than the other.  
        
    - This is called copy on write (only make copies when they are written to)

# Applications of fork

- A shell forks a new process to run an entered program command
- Most network servers run many copies fo the server in different processes
- When the kernel boots, it runs the `system.d` program, which forks off all the services and systems for your computer.
