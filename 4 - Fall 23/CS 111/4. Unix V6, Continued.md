# Recap

- Every file has an associated inode. Inodes have space for up to 8 block numbers.
- In small files, `i_addr` stores direct block numbers → blocks that contain payload data
- In large files:
    - The first `7` entries of `i_addr` are singly-indirect block numbers → blocks that contain block numbers → blocks that contain payload data
    - The last entry of `i_addr` stores a doubly-indirect block number → the number of a block that contains singly-indirect blocks → each contains block numbers → blocks that contain payload data

- Each file can be represented using at most $7 + 256 = 263$﻿ singly-indirect blocks.

# Practice: Doubly-indirect addressing

- What is the smallest file size (in bytes) that would require using the doubly-indirect block to store its data?
    - We use the doubly block if all the singly blocks are filled.
    - `7` singly-indirect blocks * `256` block numbers per block * `512` bytes per block = `917,504` bytes to fill up the first `7` entries.
        - Therefore, you need `917,504 + 1` byte to start using the doubly-indirect block.

- After reading all the blocks in block 26 (`256` total blocks), we then go to block 35 for the next singly-indirect block.
- After reading all the singly-indirect blocks, go to block `30`. From here, go to block `87` which is a singly indirect block, then go to `89` for the `256*7 + 1` = 1793rd block of payload data.

# Directory Hierarchy

- A directory is a folder, containing files and more directories
- A directory is a **file container**. It needs to store information about what files/folders are contained within it.
- On Unix/Linux, all files live within the root directory `"/"`
- We can specify the **location of a file** via the path to it from the root directory
    - This is called the absolute path: `/classes/cs111/index.html`

## Directories

- **Key idea:** the directories in Unix V6 maps filenames to inode numbers in the filesystem.
    - Filenames are not stored in the inodes, they are stored in directories → file lookup must happen via directories.

### Directory Entries

- A Unix V6 directory contains an **unsorted list of 16 byte “directory entries”**
    
    - Each entry contains the name and the inode number of one thing in that directory.

    - If the name has less than 14 characters, it has a null terminator.
    - If it is exactly 14 characters long, there is no null terminator.
        - While reading the name, just stop after 14 characters.
        - Use `strncmp` when comparing directory names, setting `n` to `14`.

## Going from filepath to inode number

- Suppose we have the filepath `/classes/cs111/index.html`
- We start at the origin root directory.

- Look through the directory entires in the root directory and find the one that matches classes.

- Repeat the same thing here.

- Once we get to our file, we find the entry. That entry gives us our inode numbers, from which we can read the payload contents.

## How are directories stored?

- Directories store directory entries – could be many entries
- Directories also have associated metadata (size, permissions, creation date, …)
- **Key idea:** let’s model a directory as a file. We’ll pretend it’s a “file” whose  
    contents are its directory entries! Each directory will have an inode, too.  
    
- **Key benefit:** we can leverage all the existing logic for how files and inodes work,  
    no need for extra work or complexity!  
    - Directories can be “small mode” or “large mode”, just like files
- Inodes can store a field telling us whether something is a directory or a file.
- Every directory has hidden entries named `.` and `..`.
    - The `.` has the same inode number as the current file.
    - The `..` has the inode number of the parent directory.

### Root Directory

- The root directory (`"/"`) is set to have `inumber` 1. That way we always know  
    where to go to start traversing. (0 is reserved to mean "NULL" or "no inode").  
    
- To do a lookup:
    
    ![Untitled 7 96.png](../../attachments/Untitled%207%2096.png)
    
    ![Untitled 8 90.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2090.png)

    ![Untitled 10 81.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2010%2081.png)
    
    - The payload for a directory inode is just the list of directory entries.

## File Lookup Practice

- The top table is the inode table. The bottom table is the actual blocks that contain data.

### Small files

- This is a file where all the blocks are small blocks.

![Untitled 12 76.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%2076.png)

![Untitled 13 72.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%2072.png)

### Medium files

- This is a file where the directory inodes are in small mode, but the file is large mode. This large mode file does not use the doubly-indirect block.

![Untitled 14 67.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2014%2067.png)

![Untitled 15 65.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2015%2065.png)

- The lookup process was the same to get to the file. However now, we had to look up all the indirect blocks.

### Large files

- This is the same as above but we use the doubly-indirect block.

# Inode to Block Number

- The inode table starts at block 2.
- Given inumber 256, our calculation is $\frac{256 - 1}{16}$﻿ → $15 + 2 = 17$﻿
    - We subtract one because inumbers are 1 indexed, so we go back to zero index
    - Then we add the offset for the start of the inode number.
- To go from inumber to the index within the block.
    - Subtract 1 for the 1-indexed offset.
    - Then mod it by 16 since there are 16 inodes per block.
    - inumber 256 is at $(256 - 1) % 16$﻿ = index 15

  

# Summary

- Small files have up to 8 direct block numbers stored in their inode
- Large files have up to 7 singly-indirect and 1 doubly-indirect block number stored in their inode
- Directories are “just files” and are layered on top of files.
    - Directories store directory entries, which contain info about each file/folder directly within that directory.
    - Note: name is at most 14 bytes, which may not be null terminated!
- The lookup process traverses through each directory in the path until we reach the file we’re looking for (or don’t find it)
