# Multiprocessing vs Multithreading

- Multiprocessing spawned other processses to do other tasks or run other programs.
    - **Powerful**: can execute/wait on other programs, secure (separate memory space), communicate with pipes and signals
    - **But limited:** interprocess communication is cumbersome, hard to share data/coordinate

# Threads

- Independent execution sequences within a single process, letting us run multiple functions in our program concurrently
- In C++: spawn a thread using `thread()` and the thread variable type
    - Specify what function you want the thread to execute
    - Optionally, can also pass parameters
- Each thread operates within the same process, so they share a virtual address space
    - The processes's stack segment is divided into a "ministack" for each thread.
    - In the OS, threads are the unit of concurrency, not processes
- Processes are like a thread container. It by default has one thread, but you can spawn more threads.
    - It’s **undefined behavior** if you fork a process while it has multiple threads.

- Running `execvp`in a single thread will wipe out the entire process, meaning every thread in that process is wiped out as well.

## Spawning threads

- You can pass a vector by reference to all the threads, and have every thread operating on the same vector at once.

## Waiting for threads

- We have to call `join()` on a specific thread to wait for it.
- We can’t do something like `waitpid(-1)`.

## Example threads program

- We can spawn multiple threads to execute the same function, then we wait for them.

- The ordering is non-deterministic, because the threads can execute at any time.

## Looping through threads

- If we want to use a for each loop for threads, we **must** use a loop by reference.

# Race Conditions

- Below is an example of a race condition. We removed the locks from the `cout`.

# Shared memory between threads

![Untitled 9 89.png](attachments/Untitled%209%2089.png)

- In the example below, all threads are using the same copy of `i`, which is updated in the for loop.
    
    ![Untitled 10 84.png](attachments/Untitled%2010%2084.png)
    
    - By the time a thread is executed, `i` can already be incremented several times.

# Pass by reference

- To pass by reference, surround the variable with `ref` in the call to `thread`, and use it like normal.

# Race condition example

- Suppose we want to parallelize the task of selling tickets.

![Untitled 12 79.png](attachments/Untitled%2012%2079.png)

- Notice that inside the while loop, we decrement `remainingTickets`, which is passed by reference to all the threads.

![Untitled 13 74.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%2074.png)

- **There is a race condition if threads interrupt each other in between checking for remaining tickets and selling them.**
    - If thread A sees tickets remaining and commits to selling a ticket, another thread B could come in and sell that same ticket before thread A does.

# Atomicity

- Atomic means it happens in its entirety without interruption. Cannot be  
    observed in the middle  
    - Even single line statements are not atomic, bc they can have multiple instructions.
    - E.g. We want a thread to do the entire check-and-sell operation uninterrupted by  
        other threads executing this region
