# Thread States

- At any time, the thread is in one of three states
    - **Running**
    - **Blocked** - it’s waiting on some event and it can’t make any more progress
    - **Ready** - able to run, but waiting for CPU time
- When a thread is created, it’s **ready**
    - **Ready → Running**: When the OS lets a thread run
    - **Running → Ready**: Thread is not blocked, but OS puts it off core to run another thread
    - **Running → Blocked**: Running thread can’t run anymore, it’s waiting so its blocked
    - **Blocked → Running**: If waiting event happens and core immediately available, it runs
    - **Blocked → Ready**: If event happens but core not immediately available, it waits
- A thread can’t go from ready to blocked.

# Scheduling

- If we have many **ready** threads, how do we decide who to run, and for how long?

## Goal of scheduling algorithms

# First-Come First-Serve

- Run all the threads in FCFS order until they finish.

- The issue is that a thread can run forever, meaning no other threads can run.

# Round Robin

- Like FCFS, but we now have a limit on the maximum time a thread can run.

- The size of the time slice is important.

    - If we make it too small, the gain we get from running the threads is outweighed by context switches.

## FCFS vs RR

- If all threads take roughly the same amount of time, the average response time of round robin is greater than FCFS

# Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT)

- Greedily pick the thread that will finish quickest and run it to completion.
    
    - This is the optimal solution for minimizing average response time.

## I/O Bound vs CPU Bound

- SRPT actually improves overall resource utilization.
    
    ![Untitled 8 96.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2096.png)
    
    - SRPT will give priority to I/O bound thread over CPU bound threads
        - This is because CPU bound needs a lot of CPU time, while I/O bound does not need much CPU time but just needs to wait for I/O

## Problems

- We don’t know which one will finish most quickly
    - Can’t actually implement SRPT in real life → need to know the future
- **Starvation:** if we have many short threads and one long one, the long one won’t be ran until all the short ones are ran.

# Priority Based Scheduling

![Untitled 9 92.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2092.png)

- Assume that the behavior of threads tends to be consistent. We just keep a series of queues (one for each priority level) to store our threads.

- Threads that are using a lot of CPU time (without blocking) will have their priority go down over time

## Problem

- There is still the posibility of neglecting long-running threads (because their priority goes down over time)

# Summary

![Untitled 13 77.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%2077.png)

- For scheduling:
    - We want to minimze response time (make threads finish quickly)
    - Use resources efficiently
    - Be fair for the threads
- SRPT is the best to minimze average response time
    - But we can’t know future, so we estimate it with priority-based scheduling
