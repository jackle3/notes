# Pipe stalling

- Not closing the **write** end of pipes can cause functionality issues.
- If a child is reading from a pipe but nothing is written, it will stall until there is something.
- If child reads from a pipe, but parent waits for child before writing anything, the child will stall while it waits for input.

    - We should write first, then wait for the child.
- If the child reads continually, and the parent doesn’t close the write end, it will stall.

    - Notice that the `close` call in the parent is after the `waitpid`. This causes the issue.
- If the child reads continually, but doesn’t close it’s own write end, it will stall.

    - The while loop will run forever because the child didn’t close its `fds[1]`.

# dup2() and rewiring file descriptors

- Used to connect a process’s STDIN/STDOUT to the magic pipe portal.
- Suppose we want to spawn a process, but have its STDIN be connected to the read end of the pipe instead of the terminal.

    - Copies the pointer at index 3 of the file descriptor table into index 0.
    - It closes the out `STDIN`, and then copies the new file descriptor table entry into it.

- We can close `fds[0]` because once we have copied it into the position where STDIN was, we don’t need the file descriptor for the read end of the pipe anymore.
    
    - In the diagram above, this is closing the yellow arrow pointing to the pipe read end.

- To wire up a pipe to feet the STDOUT of process A to the STDIN of process B:
    - Connect `A`'s STDOUT to the pipe write end
        - Write the output of `A` into the write end of the pipe.
    - Connect `B`'s STDIN to the pipe read end.
        - Read the output of `A` from the read end of the pipe and use it as input for `B`.
- **Important note:** this rewiring only happens between the child processes. We are never touching the parent’s file descriptors for STDIN and STDOUT.

# Implementing multi-process pipeline

- This works because `execvp` consumes the process and wipes everything, but it leaves the file descriptor table intact.

- The pipe is drawn that way because `fds[0]` is read, and `fds[1]` is write.

# Practice: subprocess

- The child’s STDIN is connected to the pipe read end, and the pipe write end is just a file descriptor that the parent can write to.

- Below is an example of how we would use it.
    
    ![Untitled 10 93.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2010%2093.png)
    
    - `dprintf` is like write wrapped in a loop. It will write out everything from the input into the given file descriptor (in this case, write into `sp.supplyfd`
- Here is the implementation details of `subprocess`

- Here is the actual implementation of how this works:
    
    ![Untitled 12 87.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%2087.png)
    
    - This parent process in this function returns a struct containing `fds[1]` and `pidOrZero`.

# I/O Redirection of files

![Untitled 13 81.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%2081.png)

- We only do this for either the first command or the last command in the pipeline, since those are the only ones that would either take in input from a file or write to a file.
