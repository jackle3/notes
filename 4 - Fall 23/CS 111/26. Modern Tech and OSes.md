- How do hardware advances impact the design of operating systems?

# Multicore CPUs

- Allows us to run multiple threads truly **simultanouesly**
    - So far, we’ve only been dealing with single-core, where we switch between threads really quickly (not really simultaneously)
- There are usually different types of cores (e.g. **performance** and **efficiency** cores)

# Multicore scheduling

## Shared ready queue

- The idea with the least changes is to just **share the ready queue** across all cores.
    - Use locks to synchronize access to the ready queue.
    - Each core can be interrupted separately, and threads on cores be switched separately by the dispatcher

- However, the single ready thread becomes a **bottleneck** when we have many cores, since they are all waiting for access. Works well for two cores.

## Work stealing

- To fix the issue above, we can have 1 ready queue **per core.**
- Work stealing: if one core is free, take a thread from another core’s ready queue.
    - Still has issues with load balancing:
        - If one core has 1 ready thread, that one thread can continously run
        - If one core has 30 ready threads, each of those threads have very little time
- It’s also **expensive to move a thread** to another core.

## Core affinity

## Gang scheduling

- If we have a bunch of ready threads from the same process, run them all together at the same time on different cores.

- Essentially have all of the threads for the process make progress together → likely to have lower average execution time.

# Multicore locks

- Disabling interrupts for locks only work on single-cores.
    - On single cores, if you disable interrupts, no other threads will have a chance to run.
    - On multicores, interrupts are core specific, so even if you disable interrupts, there can still be other threads running on other cores.

## Atomic instructions

- The hardware provides us instructions that are guaranteed to be atomic across all cores.

## Spinlock implementation

- Atomic instructions are key to implementing mutexes on multi-core systems.

- There is an int variable called `locked` that can be either zero or one. It is atomic.
- In the lock function, it will continuously try to change `locked` from `0` into `1`.
    - `exchange()` returns the old value of `locked`.
    - While the old value of `locked` is not zero, keep trying to change it to `1` using the atomic instruction.
- Note that the implementation above is inefficient, because there is **busy waiting**
    - Instead of putting threads to sleep, it is keeping them away and keeping them inside the `while` loop.

## Sleep lock (but race condition)

- This now allows us to put threads to sleep while it is waiting for the mutex.

- The issue here is that `q` is not atomic. Multiple threads can access `q` at the same time.

## Final implementation

- To prevent race conditions, we have to use busy-waiting to some degree.

- We basically have to combine the sleep mutex and the spinlock.

- The spinlock gives us synchronization for the `lock` code, while the sleep mutex (the queue and `int locked`) allows us to put threads to sleep and put the actual implementation code.
    - The spinlock is like disabling interrupts, preventing multiple threads from locking at once.

# Flash storage

## Writing data

- Flash storage only gives us two operations:
    - You can erase an entire segment (erase unit) by setting all bits to 1
    - You can write a single page, but you can only set bits to zeros (not ones)
- To set a section of data to be like `1010101010101`, you have to first erase the whole segment to set it to all `1111111111111`, then manually go through and write zeros.

## Wear-out

## Filesystem design

- There is an FTL (flash translation layer) that makes the flash storage look like a hard disk.
