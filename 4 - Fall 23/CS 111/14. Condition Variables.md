# Resource constraints

- Revisiting the dining philosophers problem from last time:
    - **Four** people can _try_ to eat at the same time without deadlock.
        - If only four people try to grab up forks, then there is one extra, meaning at least one person can eat.
    - **Two** people can eat at the same time.
        - Given 5 forks, only two people can have two forks to eat at the same time.
- Each of these are constraints. The first one is better because it imposes **less bottlenecking** while still solving the issue.

- We create shared counter `permits`, and a mutex for that counter.

- We can make new helper functions to do the permissioning logic with the permits.

- Here is the code for granting permission. We simply return the permit that we used.

- Here is the code for waiting for permits. The person takes a permit, or waits for one.
    
    ![Untitled 4 112.png](attachments/Untitled%204%20112.png)
    
    - The `while (true)` is the loop for waiting for the permit. We lock it, check if there are permits available, then unlock and stay in the loop if there isn’t.
        - We should wait a while because we have to wait until someone puts a permit back.
        - If we add a sleep call, this is **busy waiting** - we are unnecessarily and arbitrarily using CPU time to check when a permit is available.

# Condition variables

- A variable type that can be **shared across threads** and used for one thread to **notify other thread(s)** when something happens.
    - A thread can also use this to **wait until it is notified** by another thread.
    - Make one variable **for each distinct event** you need to wait / notify for.
    - We call **wait on the condition variable** to sleep until another thread notifies this condition variable.
        - You call `notify_all` on the condition variable to **send a notification** to all waiting  
            threads and wake them up.  
            
- Steps to using condition variables:
    1. Identify a single kind of event that we need to wait / notify for
        1. E.g. “there are permits available again”
    2. Ensure there is proper state to check if the event has happened
        1. E.g. checking the `permits` count to see if avialable
    3. Create a condition variable and share it among all threads either waiting for that event to happen or triggering that event

    4. Identify who will notify that this happens, and have them notify via the condition variable
        1. E.g. notify all when someone returns a permit and there were no permits available
            
            ![Untitled 6 109.png](attachments/Untitled%206%20109.png)
            
        2. Notify when it the # of permits goes from zero to one. **Don’t unnecessarily notify people.**
    5. Identify who will wait for this to happen, and have them wait via the condition variable
        1. E.g. If we need a permit but there are none available, wait.

## Race conditions

### Possible deadlock while waiting

![Untitled 8 98.png](attachments/Untitled%208%2098.png)

- If we give up the lock, then another thread puts a permit back and sends the notification before we can call `permitsCV.wait()`, then we won’t get a notification.
    - If that is the last notification, we may wait forever.

- Originally, there was a gap between giving the lock up and waiting for the notification.
- Now, that whole operation is atomic, and there is no gap.
    - When it says puts the caller to sleep, that means making the caller wait for the notification.
- Once it has been signaled, it will keep waiting until it reacquires the lock.

### Over-permitting

- There is still a race condition that could lead to negative permits if multiple threads are waiting on a permit.
    - Suppose we had two threads waiting for a permit.
        
        ![Untitled 11 87.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%2087.png)
        
    - Once the person is done eating, they give the permit back, and notify everyone.
        
        ![Untitled 12 84.png](attachments/Untitled%2012%2084.png)
        
    - The order that threads wake up is arbitrary. One can wake up, get the permit lock, decrement the permits, then give back the permit lock and go to eat.
        
        ![Untitled 13 79.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%2079.png)
        
    - However, the other thread also got the notification, so it will do the same thing now.
        
        ![Untitled 14 69.png](attachments/Untitled%2014%2069.png)
        
- **Key Problem:** if multiple threads are woken up for one new permit, it's possible that some of them may have to continue waiting for a permit.
    - If the permit is already taken by another thread by the time they wake up, they have to keep waiting.
    - Just because they woke up does not mean there is a permit. We need an extra check after they are done waiting to see if they can move on.
- **Solution:** we must call `wait()` in a loop, in case we must call it again to wait longer

# Pass a lock to CV.wait()

- It makes the unlocking of the lock and the subsequent waiting an atomic operation.
    
    ![Untitled 16 62.png](attachments/Untitled%2016%2062.png)
    

# Call wait() in a loop

- When a permit is put back, it wakes up **everyone.** This means the first person to wake will get the permit, meaning the other people who wake up won’t have a permit.

## Spurious wakeups

- Sometimes condition variables just wake up, even when no one else notifies.

# Copying

- Condition variables can’t be copied. You can’t create a condition variable and push it into a vector (consider how pointers might help)
