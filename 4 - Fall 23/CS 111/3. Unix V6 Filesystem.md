# Recap

- **Filesystem** is portion of OS that manages disk (persistent storage)
- Blocks are the storage unit used by the filesystem, can be 1 or more sections.
- **Contiguous allocation** allocates a file in one contiguous space
- **Linked files** allocates files by splitting them into blocks and having each block store the location of the next block.
- **Windows FAT** is like linked files but stores the links in a “file allocation table” in memory for faster access.
- **Multi-level indexes** instead store all block numbers for a file together so we can quickly jump to any point in the file.

## Fragmentation

- **Internal fragmentation:** space allocated for a file is larger than what is needed. A file may not take up all the space in the blocks it’s using, leading to waste space.
- **External fragmentation:** no single space is large enough to satisfy an allocation, even though there is enough aggregate space.

# Unix V6 Inodes

- An **inode** is a grouping of data about a single file (every file has one).
- Inodes live on disk together on a fixed-size **inode table**
    - We can read inodes into memory for faster lookup.
- The inode table starts at block 2. The inode table can span many blocks.
    - Block 0 is the boot block, block 1 is the superblock for filesystem info.
    - Around 10% of the drive stores metadata.
- Inodes are 32 bytes, and 1 block = 1 sector = 512 bytes, so 16 inodes/block
    - In Unix, **1 block is 1 sector**. Blocks can be more than 1 sector.
- Filesystem goes from filename to inode number to file data.
    - Inode number starts at 1.

## Inode Struct

- Block numbers are 2 byte numbers. The block numbers in `i_addr` are stored in order of file data, not sequential order.

## Reading inodes from disk

- Suppose we are given the functions `readSector` and `writeSector` to access the sectors.

```C
int inodesPerBlock = DISKIMG_SECTOR_SIZE / sizeof(struct inode)

// create an inodes array
struct inode inodes[inodesPerBlock]; 
// read the second sector into the inodes
readSector(2, inodes);

// loop over each inode in sector 2
for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(inodes) / sizeof(inodes[0]); i++) {
	printf("%d\n", inodes[i].i_addr[0]); // print first block num
}
```

# Inode Modes

- Unix V6 has two inode “modes”: small and large, that dictate how it uses `i_addr`

`if ((inode.i_mode & ILARG) != 0) { // inode is “large mode”`

- **Small mode** inode: all 8 block numbers are direct block numbers (block numbers of  
    blocks that store file data)  
    

## Large Mode

- **Large mode** inode: stores **7** block numbers in `i_addr`. Each of these blocks store other block numbers, which then store the data.
    - **Singly-indirect addressing**: store each group of 256 block numbers inside a block, and then store _that_ block’s number in the inode.
        - This is 256 block numbers because there are 512 bytes per block, and each block number is 2 bytes.

- The 8th entry in `i_addr` stores a block number for another block that contains singly-indirect block numbers.

- Block `555` is the overflow space for the singly-indirect blocks that don’t fit in the first 7 spaces of `i_addr`.

### Summary

- In large mode, it stores 7 singly-indirect block numbers, and 1 doubly-indirect block number.
    - Singly-indirect block: this block stores 256 block numbers, and those block store payload data.
    - Doubly-indirect block: this block stores 256 singly indirect block numbers.
