# Critical Section

- A region of code that should be executed only by **one thread** at a time.
    - Keep the critical sections as small as possible to protect the performance of parallelism and multithreading.
- Suppose this was our original function

    - It’s hard to make critical sections that span loops
- We modify the code to look like this

    - We put all the logic inside the loop, and reorder the statements to minimize the size of the critical section.
    - We also make a **local copy** of the `remainingTickets` variable to allow it to be used correctly in the print statement.
- If a race condition is possible, make a critical section.
    - Generally, if we are editing a variable that can multiple threads have access to simultaneously, that’s usually a good sign that a critical section is necessary.

# Mutexes

- Because the `lock()` blocks, the mutex allows us to limit how many processes can pass the line `myMutex.lock()`
- Create a mutex for each single variable or critical section that we must limit thread access to.
- We can have **more than one mutex** per program
    - e.g. several unrelated variables that can each be accessed simultaneously, but only by 1 thread per variable at a time.
- **Mutexes are initially unlocked**
- When a thread calls lock():
    - If the lock is **unlocked**: the thread now owns the lock and continues execution
    - If the lock is **locked**: the thread blocks and waits until the lock is unlocked
    - If multiple threads are waiting for a lock: they all wait until it's unlocked, **one receives lock** (not necessarily one waiting longest)
- `lock()` and `unlock()` are both atomic operations.

## Stalling

- If we don’t call `unlock` before exiting, it’s possible for the program to stall.

## Writing and reading

- We don’t need a mutex when we are just reading a shared variable.
- We need one when there are **multiple threads writing** to a variable
- We need one when there is a **thread writing** and one or more **threads reading**

# Deadlock

- Occurs when multiple threads are all blocked waiting on a resource owned by one of the other threads. None can make progress!

![Untitled 4 115.png](../../attachments/Untitled%204%20115.png)

- Thread A has mutex1, and it needs mutex2 before it can unlock. However, thread B has mutex2, and it needs mutex1 before it can unlock.

## Prevention

- Try to prevent circularities: all threads request resources in the same order
    - e.g. always lock mutex1 before mutex2.
- You can also limit number of threads competing for a shared resource

# Dining Philosophers

- Each fork can be used by **one** person —> make a mutex for each fork.
    
    ![Untitled 6 112.png](../../attachments/Untitled%206%20112.png)
    
- Multiple philosophers can eat at the same time, so this function is parallelized.
    
    ![Untitled 7 109.png](../../attachments/Untitled%207%20109.png)
    
- Thinking is the same as just sleeping the thread.
    
    ![Untitled 8 101.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%20101.png)
    
- When you eat, you grab the forks (lock the mutexes) and then eat.
    
    ![Untitled 9 97.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2097.png)
    

## Race condition

- There isn’t enough forks for everyone to eat at the same time, since each person needs two forks.
- If everyone **grabs their left fork** at the same time, this is a deadlock.
    - They will all wait for their right fork, which will never become available.
