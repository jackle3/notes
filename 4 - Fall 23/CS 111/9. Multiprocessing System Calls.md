# waitpid()

- A system call that a parent can call to wait for its child to exit
    
    - Allows us to stall the parent program until the **direct** child is finished.

- This is an example of this. This output is now deterministic

## Status

- We can use the `int *status` parameter to find how the child process exited.

    - `WIFEXITED` checks if the process terminated normally (without crashing or error)

## Zombie

- If child finished before we run `waitpid()`, the call to will just return immediately.

- Always call `waitpid()` once we are done with the child processes to clean them up.
    - Like freeing heap memory from your program once you are done.

## Multiple child processes

- We can either pass the PID of each child in order that they were spawned (in a loop)
    
    - We need to keep track of an array of PIDs, and we would call `waitpid` on the elements of the array in order.
    - This would wait on them in the order that they spawned.

- We can also pass `-1` as the PID, which would wait for any child to exit.
    
    - We can do this in a `while (true)` loop, and break when we see `errno == ECHILD` once we finish waiting on all the children.
    - This would just wait for whatever child finished first. Using the loop allows us to continue doing this until all children are finished.
        - The order that the children finish are not deterministic.

    - Notice that the status code for `114` and `113` are flipped, because the order is not deterministic.

# execvp()

- A function that lets us run _another program_ in the current process.

- Running `execvp` takes over and consumes the current process that it is ran in.
    
    - In the normal use case, we would spawn a new child and let `execvp` cannibalize the child process.

    - Notice that the highlighted print statement is never reached (as long as `execvp` is successful).
    - It uses the same process:
        - It cleans the memory, code, heap, stack, etc
        - It then loads in the program you told it to run and runs it brand new (as if you ran it in that process from the very beginning)
- If a child process calls `execvp`, the parent can still wait on it.
    - The process is still the child process, it’s just running another program.

# Shell

- We can only run **one program** per process, so we need to run the user’s command in another process – otherwise, the shell will go away and cease to exist
- The general procedure for a shell is
    
    1. Call **fork** to create a child process
    2. In the child, call **execvp** with the command to execute
    3. In the parent, wait for the child with **waitpid**

# Terminating the child

- Child processes will keep running until it returns from main or exits using **exit()**
    - Make sure that the child only executes code intended for the child.

- If we didn’t throw the exception, the child will continue running when `execvp` fails, continuing to run the code from main.
