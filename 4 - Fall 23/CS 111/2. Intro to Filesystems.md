# Filesystems

- A **filesystem** is a portion of the OS that manages the disk
    - The disk refers to HDDs, SSDs. They are persistent storage that can store data between power offs.

- In Unix, a sector is 512 bytes big, so you have to read the whole thing to access something in the sector.
- Hard drives simply appear as an array of sectors to the OS

- If we have a hard drive, the OS would only have access to these two functions for the functions of the hard drive.
    
    ```C
    void readSector(size_t sectorNumber, void *data);
    void writeSector(size_t sectorNumber, const void *data);
    ```
    
- We have to build the filesystem by building functions on top of these two functions.
    - The filesystem is the bridge between the lower level operations like `readSector` and `writeSector` and the functions that the user uses.

# Sectors and Blocks

- Filesystems define its own unit of data, **a block**, that it reads/writes at a time.
    - **Sector** = hard disk storage unit
    - **Block** = filesystem storage unit (1 or more sectors)
        - This is a software abstraction
        - Fewer transfer operations if **block size is larger**, but smaller files may read in more data than necessary

# Storing Files on Disk

- Two types of data we will be working with:
    1. File payload data
        1. Contents of files (e.g. text in documents, pixels in images)
    2. File metadata
        1. Information about files (e.g. name, size)
- Both must be stored on the hard disk. Otherwise, we will not have it across power-offs.

## File Payload Data

### **Contiguous allocation**

- **Allocate a file in one contiguous group of blocks**
- For each file, keep track of the number of its first sector and its length
- Keep a free list of unused areas of the disk
- **Advantages**
    - Simple, all the data is in one place.
    - Random access is easy, just jump to block address
- **Disadvantages**
    - Hard to grow files
    - Hard to lay out files
        - We may not be able to squeeze a new file into a block of free space.
        - **External fragmentation** - occurs when we have enough total space on disk, but can’t use it to store files because no blocks are big enough.

### **Linked Files**

- **Implement it like a linked list**
- Each block contains file data as well as the location of the next block
- For each file, keep track of the number of its first block in separate location
    - We just jump from the first block to the next ones to find all blocks associated with the file.
- **Advantages:**
    - Easy to grow files
    - Easier to fit files in available space
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Can’t jump to an arbitrary location in the file, since the blocks aren’t discontiguous.
    - Data is scattered throughout the disk.

### **Windows FAT**

- Like linked allocation, but store links in memory
- Instead of reading through each block and getting the link, just read through the file allocation table which is in memory.
- **Advantages:**
    - Can more quickly jump to various locations in a file.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Data scattered throughout disk
    - Still need to jump through table to get an arbitrary location in the file
    - Must store table in memory, and reload after power-offs

# Unix V6 Filesystem

- Files are not stored contiguously on disk
- **Multi-level indexes:** We store all the block numbers for a given file.

## Inodes

- Known as index node, a grouping of data about a single file.
- It’s store on disk, but we read it into memory when the file is opened.
- Stores metadata as well as an ordered list of block numbers for the payload data.
