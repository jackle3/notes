# OS vs. User Mode

- The operating system runs code in a **privileged** “kernel mode” where it can do things and access data that regular user programs cannot.
    - E.g. only OS can call **readSector**.
- System tracks whether it is in “user mode” or “kernel mode”
- The OS provides **system calls**, public functions that we can call in our user programs.
    - When these functions are called, it switches over to “kernel mode”.

# System Calls

- **System calls** are functions to interact with the operating system.
    - They are public functions provided by the operating system.
- The OS handles these tasks because they require special privileges.
    - System calls run in kernel mode, and we switch back to user mode when it’s done.
    - The OS kernel runs the code for a system call, isolating the system-level interaction from your (potentially harmful) program.

## open()

- Call `**open**` to open a file:
    
    `int open(const char *pathname, int flags);`
    
    - **pathname**: the path to the file you wish to open
    - **flags**: a bitwise OR of options specifying the behavior for file opening
    - returns a **file descriptor** representing the opened file, or -1 on error
- There are many flags possible.
    - You must include exactly one of the following flags:
        - **O_RDONLY** (read-only)
        - **O_WRONLY** (write-only)
        - **O_RDWR** (read and write)
        - These say how you will use the file in this program.
    - **O_TRUNC** means if the file exists already, truncate (clear) it.
    - **O_CREAT** creates a new file if the specified file doesn’t exist.
        
        `int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);`
        
        - You must also specify a third `mode` parameter: the permissions to attempt to set for a created file
    - **O_EXCL** means the file must be created from scratch, and to error if the file already exists. Checks by filename / pathname.
        - Generally you use this with `O_CREAT`

## File Descriptors

- Like a “ticket number” representing your currently opened file.
    - Assigned in ascending order of unused file descriptors.
- A unique number assigned by the OS to refer to that file in the **context of your program**.
    - Each program has it’s own file descriptors.
- File descriptors must be **provided** if you want to use the file (read, write, close, etc).
- OS remembers information associated with each of your file descriptors, like where in the file you currently are (if reading/writing)

## close()

- Call **close** to close a file when you’re done, like freeing memory.
    
    `int close(int fd);`
    
    - **fd:** the file descriptor you'd like to close.
- **Closing files is important** to preserve system resources.
    - Use valgrind to check if files are closed with `-track-fds=yes`

# Example: touch

- This is a replication of the `touch` command in Unix

- We try to open the file in write-only mode with **O_WRONLY**. If the file doesn’t exist, create it with **O_CREAT**. We error if the file already exists with **O_EXCL**.
- The **O_WRONLY** only specifies how we use the file **in this program.**
- The permission number in `mode` specifies permissions for everyone, for every program in the lifetime of the file.

## read()

- Call **read** to read bytes from an open file into `buf`:
    
    `ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);`
    
    - **fd**: the file descriptor for the file you'd like to read from
    - **buf**: the memory location where the read-in bytes should be put
    - **count**: the number of bytes you wish to read
    - returns -1 on error, 0 if at end of file, or the number of bytes read.
- read **may not read all** the bytes you ask it to!
    - The return value tells you how many were actually read.
    - E.g. if there aren’t that many bytes, or if interrupted
- The OS keeps track of **where in a file** a file descriptor is reading from.
    - The next time you read, it will resume where you left off.

## write()

- Call **write** to write bytes from `buf` to an open file:
    
    `ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);`
    
    - **fd**: the file descriptor for the file you'd like to write to
    - **buf**: the memory location storing the bytes that should be written
    - **count**: the number of bytes you wish to write from **buf**
    - returns -1 on error, or the number of bytes that were written
- write **may not write all** the bytes you ask it to!
    - The return value tells you how many were actually written.
    - E.g. if not enough space, or if interrupted
- The **OS** keeps track of where in a file a file descriptor is writing to. So the next time you write, it will write to where you left off.
    - However, it does not remember where in the buffer it stopped writing.

# Example: copy

- We copy the data in chunks of `kCopyIncrement` bytes.
- If `bytesRead == 0`, we are at the end of the file.
- The second `while` loop is to ensure it keeps writing until we have written everything we read.
- Notice the offset of `buffer + bytesWritten` and `bytesRead - bytesWritten` since the OS doesn’t keep track of the buffer.
