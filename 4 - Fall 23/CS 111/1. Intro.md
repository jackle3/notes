# Operating Systems

- Manages shared resources and provides functionality for programs
- Responsibilities include
    - Concurrency
    - Memory
    - Files
    - I/O devices
    - Networks
    - Security
- **System calls:** functions the operating system provides that we can call in our code. For example,
    - **open()** lets us open a file on a disk
    - **fork()** lets us spawn a new program
    - These system calls are how the shell works → typing commands in the shell basically just calls these functions.

# Course Overview

- Filesystems → Processes → Threads → Virtual Memory
