# Process and Thread State

- How does the operating system track info about threads and processes

- Note that the PCB lives until the parent calls `waitpid` on it.

## Thread State

![Untitled 1 103.png](../../attachments/Untitled%201%20103.png)

- Each thread has it’s own separate stack for its stack-allocated memory space.

    - When it’s running, it’s `%rsp` is restored.
    - When it’s not running, the thread has to store the `%rsp` for later

# Dispatching

- How does the operating system run a thread and switch between threads?

![Untitled 3 102.png](../../attachments/Untitled%203%20102.png)

- When a thread stops running, the OS takes a snapshot of the thread, save it in the thread state space, then load another thread in to the core.

## Regaining Control

- Problem: If we have one core, once we run a thread, the OS is not running anymore! How does it regain control?

## Switching between Threads

![Untitled 5 98.png](../../attachments/Untitled%205%2098.png)

- The dispatcher is not a thread → it’s code that is invoked to perform the dispatching function, switching threads
    - It lets a thread run, then switches to another thread, etc.
- The act of switching threads is called **Context switch**
    - Changing the thread currently running to another thread.
    - When switching, we must **save the current thread** state (registers) and load in the new thread state.
    - Saving the current thread allows us to resume it at a later time.
- Context switches are funky – it’s like running a function that, as part of its  execution, returns back to a  _completely different_ function in a completely different thread!
    - Can only be implemented in pure assembly because it breaks all the rules of programming languages.

## context-switch.cc

- In `main`, we make a new thread `other_thread`, then we call context switch to switch from the main thread to the other thread.
- Once it’s called, it starts running `other_func`. Then, this function context switches back to the `main_thread`, letting us finish the `main` function.
    - In this case, we call `context_switch` up in the `other_func`, but it returns after the `context_switch` in `main`
        - This is what it means by called in one function and returned in another function in another thread.

## Visualizations

- Below is a visualization of what our program looks like.

    - In this example, we have two processes, each with one thread that want to run.
    - A3 is currently running, and B1 would like to run. Notice that even though B1 is not running, the stacks are still in memory.

- To switch, we first have to save all the other registers for A3 onto its stack.

    - When a thread isn’t running, it’s stack isn’t being used. Therefore, just put the information we need to temporarily save onto its stack.

    ![Untitled 9 84.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2084.png)

- We need to keep track of the thread’s stack pointer. Therefore, this has to be saved in the thread’s state space in the process control block.

    ![Untitled 10 79.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2010%2079.png)

- Now, we can load B1’s stack pointer from its thread state space.

    ![Untitled 11 77.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%2077.png)

- Then, we just pop off all the registers for B1 and load them into the core.

### Start on One Thread, End on Another

![Untitled 19 47.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2019%2047.png)

- In this case, when `ret` is ran, it will get the address from the new thread, so it will return into the new thread, not the old thread.

# New Threads

- When a thread is just created and runs for the first time, it won’t have a “freeze frame”.
