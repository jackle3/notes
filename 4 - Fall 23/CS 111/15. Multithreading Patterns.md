# Monitor pattern

- Associate a single lock with a collection of related variables, e.g. a class
    - That lock is required to access any of those variables
- For a multithreaded program, we can **define a class** for multithreading.
    - Class has **1 mutex** instance variable
    - It also has methods to access internal variables — we’ll lock and unlock it as needed when accessing our shared state

- **Key idea** → suppose going eastbound → if other threads are going east, we can go → if they’re going west, we must wait until they are done
    - For each direction, have a condition variable for the opposing event
        - If we’re going east, we’re waiting for “no more cars west”
        - If we’re going west, we’re waiting for “no more cars east”
- Variables to share across threads:
    - 1 mutex to lock the shared state
    - 1 conditional variable for going east (no more cars west)
    - 1 conditional variable for going west (no more cars east)
    - 1 counter for number of cars going east
    - 1 counter for number of cars going west

## No monitor pattern code

- Print statements need to be inside critical section because they’re also looking at the shared state.
- Notice how we have to set up a lot of variables for our multithreading.

## First monitor pattern code

- Notice how the setup code and parameters are much cleaner. We’ve condense all the necessary information about a bridge into a class.

- However, the actual logic code itself is still the same. We can make this even simpler!

## Final monitor pattern code

- The main function itself is still the same here. It’s only in our logic itself, where we put all the logic for deciding whether to cross a bridge into the monitor pattern class!

- In the bridge class, we can now make all the instance variables private as well!
