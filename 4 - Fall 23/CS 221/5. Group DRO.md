# Group DRO

- Minimizing the average error on training examples can lead to disparities in performance between different groups.

## Gender shades

- Authors collected faces of people from varying skintones and genders. Then, they evaluated various gender classifiers.

## Linear regression with groups

- **Note:** predictor $f_{\mathbf w}$﻿ does not use group information $g$﻿.
    - Only the learning algorithm uses the group information.
- Remember that the predictor in linear regression is a line.
    - Which vector should we choose? Should we choose one closer to group $A$﻿ or one that is closer to group $B$﻿?

## Average loss

- Recall that $f_{\mathbf w}(x) = \mathbf w \cdot \phi(x)$﻿. As such, TrainLoss(w) uses Loss(x, y, w) which equals to $(\mathbf w \cdot \phi(x) - y)^2$﻿.
    - When $\mathbf w = 1$﻿, $f_{\mathbf w}(x) = x$﻿.

## Per-group loss

- We can also define the loss separately for each group.

- Notice that the loss functions are vastly different. Group $A$﻿ has a much bigger loss than $B$﻿.

## Maximum group loss

- Simply the maximum of the loss over all groups.
    - This is a pointwise maximum function. It’s the upper purple function in the graph above.

## Average loss vs. maximum group loss

- Minimizing the maximum group loss is called group DRO. The result we get gives us a worse average loss, but much better maximum group loss.
- Average loss favors majority groups, while maximum group loss gives a stronger voice to the minority groups.

## Training via Gradient Descent

- Depending on the position of $\mathbf w$﻿, we choose whichever group $g^*$﻿ has the highest loss, and evulate gradient descrpt only on the per-group loss of that group.
    - Only update parameters based on the group with the highest loss.
