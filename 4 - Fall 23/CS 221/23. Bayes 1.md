- It defines a joint probability distribution over assignments.
- The joint is the product of each of the local conditional distributions.

## Alarm Example

1. Define the three values: B (burglary), E (earthquake), A (alarm)
2. Connect the variables with directed edges to model the dependencies.
    1. Directionality represents causality.
3. For each variable, specify a **local conditional distribution** of that variable **given its parents**. The LCD governs how a variable is generated.
4. Define a joint as the product of all the LCDs

- In the case about, $\mathcal{P}$﻿ is the full distribution. The question P(Q | E = e) basically asks for the distribution of the query given the evidence.
    - It’s equal to calculate P(Q = q | E = e) for all values q
