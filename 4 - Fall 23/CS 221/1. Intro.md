    - There are 5 milestones for the project throughout the quarter: interest form, proposal, progress report, video/poster, final report.
    - Each project group will be assigned a CA mentor who will give feedback and answer questions.
- Ed (up to 2% extra credit)
    - Please help answer your classmates's questions on Ed!
    - Extra credit awarded depending on how substantial and helpful you were on Ed.

# Modeling Paradigm

- Takes a real world problem and packages them into a neat mathematical model.
- However, this is **lossy**: not all of the details of the real world can be captured.

# Inference Paradigm

- Inference is answering questions with respect to the model.

# Learning Paradigm

- First, defining model without parameters.
- Then, you get some data.
- Then, you feed it into a learning algorithm to get a model with parameters.

# Course Topics

## Reflex Models

- The simplest type of model.

## State-based models

- Takes a problem, and thinks about going from one state to another state via actions
    - E.g. going from one state of the chess board to another state.
- There are three types of state-based models.
    - **Search problems:** you control everything. You are operating in a place that has no uncertainty.
    - **Markov decision processes**: handles situations where there is randomness.
    - **Adversarial games**: handles tasks where there is an opponent working against you.

## Variable-based models

- Instead of defining how you want the solution to be found, you just declare what you want.
    - For example, you just want to solve the sudoku board. You donâ€™t care how you get to the solution.
- **Constraint satisfaction problems**: models where we only have hard constraints.
- **Bayesian networks**: variables are random variables which are dependent on each other.
