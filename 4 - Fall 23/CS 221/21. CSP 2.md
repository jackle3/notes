# Dependent Factors

# Backtracking Search

- The idea is to calculate partial assignments, and build upon them.
- The algorithm takes a partial assignment x, it’s weight w, and the domains of all the variables.

- For each value $v$﻿, we calculate $\delta$﻿, which is the product of the dependent factors $D(x, X_i)$﻿.
    - This is the multiplicative change in weight from assignment $x$﻿ to assigning $X_i$﻿ to be $v$﻿.

## AC-3

- If the domain of a variable changes, enforce arc consistency on the neighbors of that variable.

# Search

## Greedy search

- Finds **approximate** weight assignments
- Don’t backtrack at all, just always choose the value with the highest partial assignment weight.

## Beam search

- Finds **approximate** weight assignments by extending partial asssignments
- Like greedy search, but take the top K candidates.
