# Definition

- A Markov Network incorporates uncertainty into the maximum weight assignments.

- It basically tells you how likely each assignment is. You essentially convert its weight into a probability

## Marginal Probabilities

- You can use the marginal to find how likely a single variable is to take on a value

# Gibbs sampling

- This is used for computing marginal probabilities. Itâ€™s similar to local search, where you start from complete assignments.

- It goes through each variable X, then samples some value with probability equal to the conditional probability.
