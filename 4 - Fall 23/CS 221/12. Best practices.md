# Summary of machine learning

# Hyperparameters

- Design decisions (like the ones in the image above) that need to be made before running the learning algorithm.

## Choosing hyperparamteres

- We shouldn’t choose it to minimize training error.
    - This would be overfitting → include all features, no generalization or regularization
- We shouldn’t choose it to minimize testing error.
    - This would make the testing set an unreliable estimate of error.
- We **should** choose it based on the validation set.

## Validation set

- A set taken out of the training set used to optimize hyperparamters.

- Train on (training - validation) set, then evaluate on the validation set.

# Model development cycle

- Lock away the test set. Don’t touch at all until the model is trained.
