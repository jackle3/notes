### **Algorithms and Distribution in Decision-Making**

- **Key Idea**: Different algorithms can lead to varied distributions of benefits and burdens, necessitating an ethical evaluation framework.
- **Distributive Justice**: A principle providing moral guidance for processes and structures that impact the distribution of benefits and burdens in societies, applicable to all decisions that generate distributions, whether algorithmic or otherwise.

### **Principles of Distributive Justice**

- **Maximize Well-being**: Aim to secure the greatest net benefit, ensuring that as many individuals as possible benefit from a particular distribution, often considering aspects like cost and time efficiency.
- **Prioritize the Worst-off**: Focus on choosing distributions that prioritize groups and individuals who are in the most disadvantaged or vulnerable positions.
- **Avoid Compounding Historical Injustice**: Ensure that distributions do not impose further disadvantages on demographic groups that have faced historical discrimination.
- **Note**: These principles are intuitive and form a non-exhaustive list, also applicable to algorithmic decisions affecting the distribution of benefits and burdens.

### **Case Study: Vaccine Distribution**

- **Context**: Given a limited number of vaccines and a large population, the allocation of vaccines is explored at different levels (globally, nationally, and locally).
- **Principle 1 - Universal Accessibility**: Ensure that as many people as possible get vaccinated, regardless of their identity, by optimizing for quantity, cost, and time.
- **Principle 2 - Protecting the Vulnerable**: Ensure that the most vulnerable populations (considering factors like age, race, class, and comorbidity) have prioritized access to vaccines.
- **Principle 3 - Prioritizing Marginalized Groups**: Vaccinate members of historically marginalized groups first to prevent compounding existing injustices.
