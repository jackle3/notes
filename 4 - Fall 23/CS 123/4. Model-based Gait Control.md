# Main Takeaways

- Walking is achieved through inverse kinematics by setting target positions for the feet.
- Feet are coordinated through a predefined cadence and pattern.
- Changes in speed are achieved by extending the length of the stride, while leaving the cadence constant.

# Phases

- The robot always moves in pairs of feet. Two feet will move in the same way, and the other two will move in the same way.

## Swing Phase

- Front right and rear left are off the ground and front left and rear right are on the ground.
- Front left and rear right are off the ground and front right and rear left are on the ground.

## Stance Phase

- All four feet are on the ground.

# Trot

- The robot movement pattern for a trot is:
    
    - swing with one side → stance → swing with other side → stance → repeat

# Pattern

- Relative to the shoulder, the foot moves in the pattern of a triangle like the one shown.
- The stance phase is the flat edge at the bottom. Notice that it spends a lot of time here.

- To move it in this pattern, just set the target position to each vertex of the triangle.

- For reinforcement learning, you can try to learn the best positions of the feet. Instead of moving in a predefined pattern, you can learn the best foot position.
- The pattern itself will have a fixed periodic cycle that doesn’t change.

## Patterns for Speed

- To walk faster or slower we will change the shape of the pattern, not the time it takes to trace out

- Notice that the height is the same. The only difference is the length of the base.

# Reference Frame

- This is the reference frame relative to the shoulder joint.

## Displacements

- The `x_displacement` is calculated by the `target_x_velocity` multiplied by the time that we want to spend in the stance.
- The `x_foot_offset` is the product of the target velocity and the `dt`.
- For `z_foot_offset`, it’s uses `(target_height - z_height / time_remaining)`
- **x and z components computed independently of one other:**
    - z: Operates on a fixed speed and fixed distance, independent of desired velocity.
    - x: x_displacement is increased linearly with desired velocity. This results in longer strides at higher velocities.
