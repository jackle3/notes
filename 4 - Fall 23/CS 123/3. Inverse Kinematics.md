# **Forward Kinematics**

- Given a pose of a structure, what is the 3D position of a point on the structure?

$f([\theta, \phi, \sigma]) = \mathbf p$

# **Inverse Kinematics**

- Given a target position or a point on the structure, what is the pose such that the point reaches the target position.

$f(\mathbf p) = [\theta, \phi, \sigma]$

- The world is often described in the Cartesian space (x, y, z) but the movement is described in the pose space (joint angles, lengths, etc).

# Pose

- $x, y, z$﻿ is the global position
- $r, p, y$﻿ is the global rotation
- Each $\theta_1$﻿ is the rotation of each joint of the legs

  

# Why does moving in gradient give you biggest ascent?

Suppose you have $f(x + \Delta x)$﻿, and you want to maximize this function

Taylor expansion is $f(x) + \nabla f(x) \cdot \Delta x$﻿

We can’t change $f(x)$﻿. The only thing we can pick is $\Delta x$﻿.

To maximize the dot product, we have to pick $\Delta x$﻿ in the same direction as $\nabla f(x)$﻿.

Therefore, moving this way gives you the biggest increase in the function.
