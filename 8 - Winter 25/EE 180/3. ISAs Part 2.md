# Interfacing to I/O
* **Bad Idea**: special I/O instructions for each type of device
* **Good Idea**:
	* Break the problem into two parts:
		* Communicating bits to the I/O device (handled by MIPS with memory-mapped I/O)
		* Executing operations based on these bits (handled by the I/O device)
* **Memory-mapped I/O**:
	* Every device includes some registers and memory
	* We can read/write to these registers to communicate bits with the device
	* Each device has its own protocol for interpreting these bits (via drivers)
* Use `lw` and `sw` to move bits to/from I/O devices
	* A load moves bits from an I/O device register to a CPU register
	* A store moves bits from a CPU register to an I/O device register

# Control Flow
* Two types of control flow operations:
	* **Conditional branches**:![[Pasted image 20250115154809.png]]
	* **Unconditional jumps**:![[Pasted image 20250115154822.png]]
## If-then-else Example
```c
if (i == j) f = g + h;
else f = g â€“ h;
```

## More Complex Comparisons
* We need a two-instruction sequence to branch on other comparisons:
	1. A comparison instruction that sets a result register to 0 or 1+ (e.g. `slt`)
	2. An eq/neq branch instruction that uses this result register (e.g. `beq` or `bne`)
```c
// C code
if (f | g) goto Less;

// MIPS assembly
or $t0, $f, $g			// $t0 = f | g
bne $t0, $zero, Less	// if $t0 != 0, branch to Less
```

![[Pasted image 20250115155610.png]]
```c
// C code
if (a < 8) goto Exceed;

// MIPS assembly
slti $t0, $a, 8		// $t0 = 1 if a < 8, 0 otherwise
bne $t0, $zero, Exceed	// if $t0 != 0, branch to Exceed
```

## Pseudoinstructions
* MIPS only provides a few instructions for comparisons.
	* We can't compare two registers directly.
	* Reason: in earlier tech, comparison to 0 was common and much faster than comparing two registers
* Comparisons are really fast now, so we can add more complex comparisons (e.g. pseudoinstructions) to the ISA.
	* Disadvantage: more complex instructions, older binaries cannot benefit from this
* **Pseudoinstructions**:
	* These are instructions that are not part of the MIPS instruction set.
	* They are used to make the code more readable and easier to write.
	* They are translated into MIPS instructions by the assembler.
* **Example**:
	`bgt $t0, $t1, Exceed     # Branch if $t0 > $t1`
* **Translation**:
	`slt $t2, $t1, $t0        # Set $t2 = 1 if $t1 < $t0 (i.e. if $t0 > $t1)`
	`bne $t2, $zero, Exceed   # Branch if $t2 != 0`

# For Loops
![[Pasted image 20250115160548.png]]
* Consider the following C code:
	![[Pasted image 20250115160555.png|700]]
* We can convert this to code that uses gotos:
	![[Pasted image 20250115160616.png|700]]
* This can be directly translated to assembly:

# Switch Statements

## Jump Table
* Jump tables are good if the number of cases are integer constants and dense (i.e. no integer gaps between cases)
* This is because we use the case number as an index into the jump table

# Instruction Encodings
Instructions are encoded in 3 forms, depending on their operands:
* **R-type**: 3 register operands
* **I-type**: 2 registers and one 16-bit immediate
* **J-type**: 0 registers and one 26-bit address
All three instruction types are 32 bits in length, and the first 6 bits are the opcode.
## R-Format
* Used for ALU instructions that operate on multiple registers
![[Pasted image 20250115161202.png|700]]
![[Pasted image 20250115161103.png|700]]

## I-Format
* Used for ALU instructions that operate on a register and an immediate
* Also used for loads, stores, branches, and jump register

![[Pasted image 20250115161151.png|700]]
### Branching and Labels
* Labels are encoded based on the PC value (PC-relative addressing)
	* The address of the label inside the branch is calculated as `PC + 4 + 4 * immediate`
![[Pasted image 20250115161321.png|700]]

### Branching Far Away
![[Pasted image 20250115161634.png|700]]

## J-Format
* The opcode is used to identify the jump type (e.g. `j` or `jal`)
* It uses absolute addressing since long jumps are common (as opposed to PC-relative addressing)
* It is **pseudodirect addressing**:
	* We have 26 bits for the target address
	* Since instructions are 4-byte aligned, we multiply by 4 (shift left 2 bits)
	* This gives us 28 bits total = 256MB of addressable memory
	* The upper 4 bits come from the PC, so we can only jump within the same 256MB region
![[Pasted image 20250115161958.png]]
* How to jump more than 256MB away?
	* We can use a register to store the full 32-bit address and jump to it using `jr`
	* This allows us to jump anywhere in the 4GB address space
	* Example of loading 32-bit immediate:
```mips
lui $t0, upper_16_bits   	  # Load upper 16 bits of target address
ori $t0, $t0, lower_16_bits   # Load lower 16 bits
jr $t0   					  # Jump to address in register
```
