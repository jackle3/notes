# Big Picture
* Computers work with binary signals (0 or 1 bits)
	* More complex stuff are expressed as a sequent of bits
	* Memory cells preserve bits over time
	* Logic gates operate on bits
* To get the HW to compute something
	* We express it as a sequence of simple instructions that are encoded as strings of bits

# ISA
* An ISA is a HW/SW interface that defines a **contract** between HW and SW (e.g. defines compilers, assemblers)
* It defines:
	* The **state** of the system (e.g. memory structure, registers, stack)
	* The functionality of each HW instruction
	* The encoding of each HW instruction (what is the bits for each instr.)
* It fits between HW and SW:
	* Allows HW and SW to proceed in parallel, while still allowing HW to make optimizations for SW and vice versa
![[Pasted image 20250109151706.png]]
* ISAs **last a long time** with many different implementations of it
	* Though because of **backwards compatibility**, features are almost never removed from ISAs ⟶ features are added though
* The choice of ISA is important:
	* Compiler and assembler is dependent on what ISA you are using.
	* If you have a legacy binary but no source code, you can only use that binary on the ISA that it was compiled for.

# MIPS ISA
* Four key design principles:
	* Smaller is faster
	* Making the common case fast
		* E.g. `$0` is the value `0` in MIPS because `0` is used often
	* Good design demands good compromises
		* E.g. alignment rules for memory access
	* Simplicity favors regularity
		* E.g. more predictable inputs, such as instruction length always being 32 bits

## System State
* **Registers:** 32 general purpose 32-bit registers
* **Memory:** MIPS uses 32-bit address space, meaning it can address up to $2^{32}$ unique locations.
	* It is byte addressable, so there can be $2^{32}$ bytes or $4$ GB of memory.

## Instruction Formats
* **Program:** a sequence of instructions
* **Instruction:** a 32-bit sequence stored in memory. There are three formats:
	* Register format
		![[Pasted image 20250109152253.png]]
	* Immediate format
		![[Pasted image 20250109152303.png]]
	* Jump format
		![[Pasted image 20250109152310.png]]

## Instruction Execution
1. Fetch next instruction
	* Read contents at address in program counter from memory
2. Decode instruction
3. Execution instruction and modify state

# C Vs MIPS I Interface

# Why Registers?

## RISC Vs CISC
![[Pasted image 20250109152610.png]]

## Using Registers
* Registers are a **finite resource** that needs to be managed by the programmer or the compiler
* **Goal:** keep data in registers as much as possible
* **Issues:**
	* Registers can spill to memory when all in use
	* Some data like arrays is too large to store in registers

# Instructions
![[Pasted image 20250109152748.png]]

# Arithmetic Instructions
![[Pasted image 20250109152852.png]]

## Complex Operations
* For more complex operations, we can break it up into multiple instructions and use temporary registers
![[Pasted image 20250109152907.png]]

## Arithmetic Overflow
* We need to work with both signed and unsigned numbers, both of which can overflow.

![[Pasted image 20250109152948.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250109153008.png]]

## Constants
* To perform constant operations, we can use **immediate instructions**
![[Pasted image 20250109153039.png]]

## Summary
* Unsigned instructions do not emit an overflow signal; it only drops the overflowed bit
* Signed instructions stop the program and throw an exception.

# Logical Instructions
![[Pasted image 20250109153156.png]]
* Notice the different types of shifts:
	* `sll` ⟶ shift left and fill LSB with zeros
	* `srl` ⟶ shift right and fill MSB with zeros
	* `sra` ⟶ shift right and fill MSB with sign bit

## Bit Manipulation
* We could use bitwise operators to do things like get the middle 17 bits
![[Pasted image 20250109153322.png]]

## Loading 32-bit Immediates
* Notice that our load instructions can only take 16-bit immediates.
* We can use `lui` (load upper imm) and `ori` (or imm) to load it into a register.
![[Pasted image 20250109153531.png]]

# Data Transfer
* All accesses between registers and memory happen via `load` and `store`
![[Pasted image 20250109153549.png]]

## Instructions
![[Pasted image 20250109153617.png]]
* Instructions use **displacement addressing mode**
	* This makes the common case faster ⟶ e.g. base is start of array, load sequential elements in array
	* `Effective address = base + offset`
![[Pasted image 20250109153643.png]]

## Loading Data
* In this case, we don't need any offset because the base is the one we want.
![[Pasted image 20250109153736.png]]

* We need an offset here because we're indexing an array.
	* Notice the offset is the index times the size of the load (word is 4 bytes, so `7 * 4 = 28`)
![[Pasted image 20250109153802.png]]

* We don't need an offset here because we precompute the offset using the variable.
![[Pasted image 20250109153816.png]]

## Storing Data
![[Pasted image 20250109153847.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250109153856.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250109153901.png]]

## Summary
* There are also unsigned and regular loads.
	* **Unsigned:** when loading a half word, fill the upper half with zeros
	* **Regular:** when loading a half word, fill the upper half with the sign bit
![[Pasted image 20250109153912.png]]

# MIPS Alignment
* MIPS requires that the data must fall on addresses that are multiples of the data size.
![[Pasted image 20250109154016.png]]
* This is because even though the ISA presents memory as a linear array of bytes, it's built as 2D arrays.
	* Unaligned memory would require us to load from two different lines in the 2D array.
![[Pasted image 20250109154038.png]]
* The drawback is **fragmentation**
	* To fix the below, we should store it as `[sm, sm, med, lrg]`
	* In this case, the memory is now aligned because the addresses for `med` are divisible by 2, and address for `lrg` is divisible by 4.
