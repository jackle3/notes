# Pipeline Hazards
* Situations that prevent completing an instruction every cycle (leads to CPI > 1)
* **Structure Hazards** ⟶ a required resource is busy
* **Data Hazards** ⟶ Must wait for previous instruction to produce/consume data
* **Control Hazards** ⟶ Next PC depends on previous instruction

## Structural Hazards
* Resource conflict when **two instructions need same hardware** in same cycle
* Example: Pipeline with single unified memory
	* If instruction memory and data memory share same physical memory
	* Load/store instructions need memory access for data
	* Instruction fetch also needs memory access
	* One must stall while other accesses memory
	* Creates a "bubble" in pipeline
* Other examples:
	* Functional units not fully pipelined (e.g. multiply/divide)
		* Unit busy with previous operation when next instruction needs it
		* Must stall until unit available
	* Register file when simultaneous read/write needed
		* Though modern designs typically handle this with special hardware

* To solve this, we used delayed write-back:
	* Force ALU instruction to delay write by one cycle so that pipeline works

## Data Hazards

* In the 5-stage pipeline, we do not need to worry about:
	* WAW hazard because the write-backs for subsequent instructions will be staggered in program order.
	* WAR hazard because the read is before the write in the pipeline, meaning that the reads and writes will be staggered in the correct program order.
* However, we do need to worry about RAW hazards.

### Stalls
![[Pasted image 20250130144408.png]]
* To create the bubbles, we can set control signals to perform a `nop`
	* An operation that does not change the control flow or update any registers

### Reducing Stalls: Fast RF
![[Pasted image 20250130144649.png]]
* Writes to a register file happen in first half of cycle, reads happen in the second half.
	* This allows us to reduce the number of stalls.

### Reducing Stalls: Forwarding
![[Pasted image 20250130144751.png]]
* We can eliminate all stalls due to RAW hazards for all arithmetic and logical instructions.
	* The result from the `add` already exists after `EX` in cycle 3.
	* Instructions that need that result can pull it from the pipeline register in cycle 3 instead of waiting for the write-back in cycle 4.

### Forward Limitation: Loads
* We can't use forwarding to elim stalls when using `lw`
	* Value of load is not available until end of the `MEM` stage.
![[Pasted image 20250130144844.png]]
* We need to have a one cycle stall when loading values.

* Data hazards occur when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that hasn't completed yet:
	1. EX/MEM forwarding cases:
		* Occurs when an instruction needs a register value that was just computed in the previous instruction (EX/MEM forwarding)
		* Case 1a: Forward from EX/MEM when the previous instruction's destination register (RegisterRd) matches the current instruction's source register (RegisterRs)
		* Case 1b: Forward from EX/MEM when the previous instruction's destination register (RegisterRd) matches the current instruction's target register (RegisterRt)
	2. MEM/WB forwarding cases:
		* Occurs when an instruction needs a register value that was computed two instructions ago (MEM/WB forwarding)
		* Case 2a: Forward from MEM/WB when the previous instruction's destination register (RegisterRd) matches the current instruction's source register (RegisterRs)
		* Case 2b: Forward from MEM/WB when the previous instruction's destination register (RegisterRd) matches the current instruction's target register (RegisterRt)
* The forwarding unit detects these dependencies by comparing register numbers and routes the correct value from either the EX/MEM or MEM/WB pipeline registers back to where it's needed in the EX stage.
* **Note**: we only forward instructions if:
	* the older source instruction will write to a register (not to mem or zero)
		* Need `EX/MEM.RegWrite = 1` or `MEM/WB.RegWrite = 1` meaning to write back to a register
		* Need `EX/MEM.RegisterRd ≠ 0` or `MEM/WB.RegisterRd ≠ 0` meaning destination is not register zero
		* Need `EX/MEM.MemToReg==0` for EX/MEM forwarding because this means data we're writing back is from ALU result, not memory (for MEM/WB forwarding we can forward load results)
	* the younger instruction will actually read from the register
		* Need `ID/EX.RegisterRs = EX/MEM.RegisterRd` or `ID/EX.RegisterRt = EX/MEM.RegisterRd` for EX/MEM forwarding
		* Need `ID/EX.RegisterRs = MEM/WB.RegisterRd` or `ID/EX.RegisterRt = MEM/WB.RegisterRd` for MEM/WB forwarding

# Datapath with Forwarding
* Notice that each stage barrier has additional registers that store the results to help with forwarding.
![[Pasted image 20250204142428.png]]

# Datapath with Hazard Detection
* Recall that with loading, we need to stall for one cycle.
![[Pasted image 20250204142608.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250204142535.png]]

* Notice that we have control signals from the hazard detection unit
	* This **allows for stalls**: sends zeros to nop the current instruction, and also prevents the PC from being updated.

# Compiler Optimizations
* Compilers can rearrange code to try to avoid load-use stalls
	* This is known as "filling the load delay slot"
	* The idea is to find an independent instruction that can be placed between the load and use (bc load stalls use by 1 cycle)
* When successful, no stall is introduced dynamically
* Requirements for filling the load delay slot:
	* Must find an independent instruction from before or after the load-use
	* Cannot have any data dependencies with the load-use instructions
	* Cannot have any control dependencies with the load-use instructions
	* Cannot introduce any exception issues
* When the compiler cannot fill the slot:
	* In modern processors: leave it as is, hardware will introduce a stall
	* In original MIPS (no hardware stalls): a NOP instruction was required in the slot
