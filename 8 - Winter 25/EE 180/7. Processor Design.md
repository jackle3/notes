## Instruction Steps

## Initial Processor Datapath

# Fetching the Instruction
1. `Instruction = Memory[PC]`
	* Fetch the instruction from memory
	* In MIPS, instructions are always 32 bits
2. Update program counter for next cycle
	* Address of next instruction is `PC <- PC + 4` (assuming byte addressing)

## Decoding the Instruction
* MIPS ISA has some nice characteristics that makes decoding easy:
	* Instructions are fixed length â€” easy to find next instruction
	* Source registers are always in the same place (or not present)
	* Can read registers in parallel with decoding the instruction

## Register Instructions
* Note that the registers take up 5 bits bc we have $2^{5} = 32$ registers

## Immediate Instructions
### Arithmetic

![Pasted image 20250128140904](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250128140904.png)
* For immediates:
	* `RegDst` should be `0` because destination reg is `rt`
	* `ALUSrc` should be `1` because we use immediate for op

# Control Signals
![Pasted image 20250128143940](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250128143940.png)

* **RegDst**: Selects destination register for the result. 
	* If `0`, the `rt` is used as the destination register (immediates)
	* If `1`, the `rd` is used as the destination register (R-type instructions)
	* If `RegWrite` is `0`, then `RegDst` is `X` (don't care)
* **ALUSrc**: Selects the second input to the ALU.
	* If `0`, uses register value from `rt` (R-type instructions)
	* If `1`, uses sign-extended immediate value (immediate instructions)
* **MemtoReg**: Selects what data gets written to the destination register.
	* If `0`, writes ALU result (arithmetic operations)
	* If `1`, writes data from memory (load instructions)
* **RegWrite**: Controls whether a register is written to at the end of the instruction.
	* Set to `1` for instructions that write results to registers (e.g. arithmetic, load)
	* Set to `0` for instructions that don't write to registers (e.g. store, branch)
* **MemWrite**: Controls whether data is written to memory.
	* Set to `1` for store instructions
	* Set to `0` for all other instructions
* **MemRead**: Controls whether data is read from memory.
	* Set to `1` for load instructions (reads data from memory)
	* Set to `0` for all other instructions
* **Branch**: Indicates if instruction is a branch.
	* Set to `1` for branch instructions (modifies PC if branch condition met)
	* Set to `0` for non-branch instructions
* **Jump**: Indicates if instruction is a jump.
	* Set to `1` for jump instructions (unconditional PC change)
	* Set to `0` for non-jump instructions
* **ALUOp**: Controls what operation the ALU performs.
	* `00` for addition (load/store)
	* `01` for subtraction (branch)
	* `10` for R-type operations (determined by funct field)

* Solution: find the worst case path, and adjust the clock period to the delay of the worst case computation.
