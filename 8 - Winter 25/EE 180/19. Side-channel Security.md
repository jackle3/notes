# Hardware Side-Channel Leakage
**Side-channel attacks** occur when a malicious program (the **attacker**) can steal sensitive information from a **victim program** by observing how the victim program affects shared hardware resources.
1. The **victim program** runs instructions that use hardware resources (like caches or branch predictors) differently depending on secret values
2. These hardware resources act as a **channel** that leaks information about the secret values
3. The **attacker program** can measure timing differences or other effects to determine how the victim used the shared resources
4. From these measurements, the attacker can deduce the victim's secret values (e.g. operands)
For example:
* If the victim transmits `ld [addr]`, and the channel (e.g. cache) behaves differently depending on the address…
* The attacker can observe these differences to infer the secret address value.

Research has found that many instructions leak some of their operands.

# Side-Channel Defense
Ensure that a specific **victim program** running on a specific **microarchitecture** does not leak its private data to an attacker via hardware side-channels.

## Microarchitectural Leakage Contracts
Some architectures have published leakage contracts: list of transmitters and their "unsafe" operands.
* To defend, prevent secrets from reaching these transmitter operands

# Spectre Attack
Suppose the victim had a function that read values from memory. Suppose they also had a check like `if (i < len(A))` to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* If the attacker can control the input to this function, they can leak the memory because of **speculative execution**
	* When the branch mispredicts (i.e. `i >= len(A)`), the processor will have already executed the speculative memory access
	* The attacker can then observe the side-channel leakage (e.g. cache hit/miss) of this access

Suppose an attacker wants to read some secret data at memory address `secAddr` that lies beyond the bounds of array `A`. Here's how the Spectre attack works step by step:
![Pasted image 20250311140954](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250311140954.png)
1. Train the branch predictor:
	* Repeatedly call the victim function with valid indices (i < len(A))
	* This trains the predictor to expect the bounds check to pass
	* The processor will then speculatively execute the array access
2. Prepare the cache:
	* Flush array `B` entirely from the cache
	* This ensures a clean state for the attack
3. Execute the attack:
	* Call victim function with malicious index (secAddr - &A)
	* When we access `val = A[i]`, this accesses `Mem[&A + (secAddr - &A)] = Mem[secAddr]`
	* Due to the trained branch predictor:
		* Processor assumes bounds check passes
		* Speculatively loads value from `secAddr`
		* Uses this value to index into array `B`
		* `B[64 * Mem[secAddr]]` gets cached before branch resolves
4. Extract the secret:
	* Reload array `B` by accessing every element and recording the time
	* Fast access time indicates cache hit
	* The index with fast access = secret value from `secAddr`
	* This works because only `B[64 * Mem[secAddr]]` was cached

# Transient Execution Attacks
Transient execution attacks exploit temporary (transient) execution states that occur during:
**Spectre (Branch Misprediction)**
* Processor speculatively executes instructions after branch
* If mispredicted, results are rolled back but side-effects remain
* Attacker can:
	* Train branch predictor to mispredict
	* Use speculation window to access unauthorized memory
	* Leak data through cache timing side-channel
**Meltdown (Exception Handling)**
* Processor continues executing instructions after exception
* Results eventually discarded but side-effects remain
* Attacker can:
	* Trigger exception (e.g. access kernel memory)
	* Use transient window before exception handled
	* Leak privileged data through cache side-channel
Both attacks exploit the gap between when unauthorized access occurs and when the processor detects/handles it. During this window, attackers can extract sensitive data through side-channels.

# Verifying Hardware Adherence to Leakage Contracts
Hardware designers must verify their designs adhere to security contracts (e.g. leakage contracts) that specify allowed information flows.

## RTL2MuPath
RTL2μPath helps check if computer hardware is secure by creating maps of how instructions flow through the processor. Think of it like a GPS tracking system that:
1. Takes hardware design code as input
2. Creates a detailed map showing how each instruction moves through the processor, cycle by cycle
3. Uses these maps to check if the hardware could accidentally leak secret information through timing differences
These instruction maps (called μPaths) help hardware designers find and fix security problems before the chip is manufactured, similar to how architects review building plans to ensure safety before construction begins.

The μPath itself is a cycle-directed graph that maps from state in cycle `i` to state in cycle `i+1`. To verify, we go through each node in the μPath and check if the secret data is not leaked.
