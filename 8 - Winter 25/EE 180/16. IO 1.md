# So Far: Hardware Support for the OS

# Hardware Modes
There are two modes that are strictly needed, but some architectures have more. MIPS has two modes:
* **User Mode**: the mode used to run all user programs
* **Kernel Mode**: the mode used to run a lot (but not all) of the OS code

* There are a few registers that are specific to the kernel. Here is a subset:

* On reset, the MIPS processor is in Kernel mode. The PC is set to point to a fixed reset vector in the MIPS architecture.

* Why is VM enough to protect the OS from user programs?
	* The OS controls the page tables and permission bits for each process
	* User programs can only access memory through virtual addresses that get translated
	* The OS can mark its own pages as kernel-only in the page tables
	* When in user mode, attempts to access kernel pages will cause a fault
	* This prevents user programs from reading or modifying OS memory

* Why is virtual memory enough to protect user programs from each other?
	* Each process has its own page table controlled by the OS
	* Virtual addresses in one process map to different physical pages than in other processes
	* Processes cannot access physical memory directly, only through their virtual address space
	* The OS ensures page tables don't overlap between processes
	* Even if processes use the same virtual addresses, they map to different physical pages

# Typical I/O
## Server I/O
* Each processor has PCIe ports that can connect to I/O devices
* There is an additional chipset that provides connections to additional I/O devices

# I/O Devices Diversity
* I/O devices are characterized by:
	* Behavior: input, output, or storage
	* Partner: human or another machine
	* Data rate: speed of the device, in bytes per second or transfers per second
	* Required response time: how fast the device needs to respond to the request

## Throughput-Latency Tradeoff
![Pasted image 20250227142842](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250227142842.png)

* The equation for throughput is $T = T_0 \times \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}$ where:
	* $T$ is average total latency (including waiting time and service time)
	* $T_0$ is base response time (the time it takes to process a single request with no contention)
	* $\rho$ is the utilization factor, between 0 and 1 (throughput relative to maximum capacity)

# Magnetic Hard Disks

* In this diagram, there are three platters. We access the data using a magnetic head that is attached to the surface of each platter.
* All the magnetic heads move to the same track on all the platters at the same time.
