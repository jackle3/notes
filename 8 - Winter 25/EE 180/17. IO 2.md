# HW/SW Interface for I/O
We need to communicate control and data to/from each I/O device
**Common Approach:**
* Build a design interface using registers and buffers
* Memory/mapped I/O ‚ü∂ with some help from virtual memory

## Example Register Interface: Serial I/O Controller
**Data Registers**
* `TxD` (transmit data) and `RxD` (receive data)
* Read/write to these registers can trigger actions or side effects

**Command/status registers**
* Bits for status: `TxRdy`, `RxRdy`
* Bits to record errors: ECC error, overrun, framing error, etc
* Bits to control response: interrupt enables
* Bits to configure: data rate, framing, etc

## Memory Mapped I/O
* Portions of the physical address space are assigned to **each I/O device**
	* I/O addresses correspond to device registers and buffer
	* Read/write to these addresses to modify registers and control device
* **User programs prevented** from issuing I/O operations directly since I/O address space is protected by the address translation mechanism (virtual memory)

# Device Drivers
**How does software make sense of all these different device interfaces?**

# Physical Interface for I/O
**How do we physically connect cores, memories, and I/O devices physically?**
* Answer: using **buses** and **point-to-point links** and **switch-based interconnects**

# Bus

* Communications on the bus are called **transactions**

* We've actually already seen buses: the control signals between CPU/cache/mem
	* A bus that connects two devices is a **point-to-point link**

* There are processor-memory buses and I/O or peripheral buses

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

## Increasing Bus Bandwidth
1. We can increase the **width** of the bus to transfer more data per cycle
![[Pasted image 20250304141757.png]]
2. We only need to transfer both data and the address. We can use separate bus lines for address and data to transfer in parallel

3. We can amortize the cost by doing a block transfer. The master sends a single address, and the slave returns a burst of data

## Accessing the Bus
![[Pasted image 20250304142328.png]]

## Multiple Initiators
* When there are multiple initiators, arbitration must be used so that only one device is granted access to the bus at a time

### Arbitration
* The bus initiator wanting to use the bus asserts a bus request
* The bus initiator cannot use the bus until the request is granted
* Once the bus initiator is finished, it must signal the arbiter to release the bus

### Bus Arbitration Goals
* Bus priority: the highest priority devices should be serviced first
* Fairness: lowest priority devices should be serviced eventually, should not starve

### Latency
* To minimize the latency of arbitration, we can arbitrate and decide the next initiator while the current one is still using the bus.
* This amortizes the cost of arbitration and ensures the bus is used as much as possible

### Centralized Parallel Arbitration

# I/O Notifications
**How does the OS or our program know that something interesting happened in the I/O device?
* E.g. a packet arrived on the network interface
* E.g. an error occurred while reading the disk
