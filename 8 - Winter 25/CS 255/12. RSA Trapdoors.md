# Chosen Ciphertext Attacks
This is an extension of the Semantic Security from last time.
* Before, the adversary was passive ⟶ it could only see the ciphertext and tries to guess which plaintext was encrypted
* Now, the adversary can be active ⟶ it can decrypt any ciphertext it wants and get back the decryption of that ciphertext

# Trapdoor Functions
**Def**: A trapdoor function $X \to Y$ is a triple of efficient algorithms $(\text{Gen}, F, F^{-1})$ where:
* $\text{Gen}$ is a randomized key generation algorithm that outputs a key pair $(pk, sk)$
* $F(pk, \cdot)$ is a deterministic algorithm that defines a function $X \to Y$
* $F^{-1}(sk, \cdot)$ defines a function $Y \to X$ that inverts $F(pk, \cdot)$
More precisely, for all $(pk, sk) \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} \text{Gen}$ and all $x \in X$, we have:
$$
F^{-1}(sk, F(pk, x)) = x
$$

## Secure TDFs
A TDF is secure if $F(pk, \cdot)$ is a one-way function, meaning it can be evaluated but not inverted without $sk$

# Building a TDF
## Review: Arithmetic mod Composites
* Give two distinct primes, calculating $N = p \times q$ is easy
* Given $N$, prime factorizing $N$ into $p$ and $q$ is hard
![Pasted image 20250226135516](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226135516.png)
* When $N$ is prime, the size of $\mathbb{Z}_N^*$ is $N-1$ (every other number is coprime with $N$)
* When $N$ is the product of two distinct primes, the size of $\mathbb{Z}_N^*$ is $(p-1)(q-1)$
	* $p$ and $q$ are on the order of $\sqrt{N}$, so $(p-1)(q-1)$ is on the order of $N$
	* This means almost all elements in $\mathbb{Z}_N$ is invertible
	* Note that $\mathbb{Z}_N^*$ is not cyclic, but it is a group

## RSA Trapdoor Permutation
**Gen**:
* Pick two random distinct primes $p$ and $q$.
* Choose two integers $e$ and $d$ such that $e \cdot d \equiv 1 \mod (p-1)(q-1)$. You can do this by picking a random $e$ then computing $d = e^{-1} \mod (p-1)(q-1)$.
![Pasted image 20250226142856](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226142856.png)

**Forward**: $F(pk, x) = x^e \mod N$
![Pasted image 20250226142928](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226142928.png)

**Backwards**: $F^{-1}(sk, y) = y^d \mod N$
* This works because $e \times d = 1 \in \mathbb{Z}_{N}$, meaning $e \times d = 1 + k \times (p-1)(q-1)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$
* We also know that $x^{\phi(N)} = 1 \mod N$, so we've successfully inverted

## RSA Assumption
* Given $(N, e, y)$, there is no efficient algorithm to compute $y^{1/e}$

# RSA PKE (ISO Standard)
* RSA by itself is not an encryption scheme (since it is deterministic)
* We need randomness, hence we choose a random $x \in \mathbb{Z}_N^*$ as an intermediate

# RSA in Practice
The ISO standard is the only correct way, but it wasn't developed until the 2000s so in practice a lot of systems use the following system.
![Pasted image 20250226144223](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226144223.png)

## PKCS1 V1.5
This was the standard way before the ISO standard to use RSA for encryption
* The message is padded with zeros and a random pad ⟶ $m' = \text{PKCS1}(m)$
* This padded message is the one that's encrypted ⟶ $c = m'^e \mod N$
![Pasted image 20250226144340](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226144340.png)

### Attack on PKCS1
* The attacker can learn about the 16 MSBs of the plaintext by seeing if the server errors or not while decrypting the ciphertext.

![Pasted image 20250226144756](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226144756.png)

### Defense
1. Generate a random string $R$ of 46 random bytes
2. Decrypt the message to recover the plaintext $M$
3. If the PKCS1 padding is incorrect, instead of returning an error, return $R$
4. Otherwise, return $M$

## PKCS1 V2.0: OAEP
This is a more secure variant of PKCS1 that provides CCA security
* Instead of checking the header, we simply check if the pad is all zeros

### Wiener's Attack
* We are given $N$ and $e$, and we know that $d = e^{-1} \mod \phi(N)$.
* In addition, we know that $d < N^{0.25}$
* This is enough information to efficiently compute $d$

Since $e \cdot d = 1 \mod \phi(N)$, we have $e \cdot d = 1 + k \cdot \phi(N)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
$$
\begin{align*}
e \cdot d = 1 + k \cdot \phi(N) \\
e \cdot d - k \cdot \phi(N) = 1 \\
\frac{e}{\phi(N)} - \frac{k}{d} = \frac{1}{d \cdot \phi(N)} \tag{dividing both sides by $d \cdot \phi(N)$}\\
\end{align*}
$$

## Small Public Exponent
* In practice, $e$ is often chosen to be small. This makes encryption faster but decryption is slower.
