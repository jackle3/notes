# Finite Cyclic Groups
$G = (G, \cdot)$ is a **finite cyclic group** of prime order $q$ and generator $g \in G$ if $(G, \cdot)$ is a group and $G = \{g^0, g^1, \cdots \}$.

## Computational Diffie-Hellman Assumption
In the group $G$ with generator $g$, the CDH assumption holds if for all efficient adversaries $A$, the probability of $A$ outputting $g^{\alpha \cdot \beta}$ given $g$, $g^\alpha$, and $g^\beta$ is negligible when $\alpha, \beta$ are chosen randomly from $\mathbb{Z}_q$
$$
\Pr[A(g, g^\alpha, g^\beta) \rightarrow g^{\alpha \cdot \beta}] \leq \text{negligible}
$$

* If the CDH assumption is hard in $G$, then the D-H key exchange in $G$ is secure against eavesdroppers

## Discrete Logarithm Problem
Given an element in our group $h \in G$, find $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ such that $g^\alpha = h$
* Notice that $\alpha$ is over the group $\mathbb{Z}_q$, which is the set of integers modulo a prime $q$
* The solution is below, though calculating this discrete log is hard
$$
\alpha = \text{DiscreteLog}_{g} h
$$

Formally, the discrete log assumption holds in $(G, g)$ if for all efficient adversaries $A$, the probability of $A$ outputting $\alpha$ given $g$ and $g^\alpha$ is negligible when $\alpha$ is chosen randomly from $\mathbb{Z}_q$
$$
\Pr[A(g, g^\alpha) \rightarrow \alpha] \leq \text{negligible}
$$

### Example: Additive Group
* Let $G = \mathbb{Z}_p = \{0, 1, \cdots, p-1\}$ where the group operation is addition modulo $p$
* The generator of the group is $g = 1$ because $\{g^0, g^1, g^2, \cdots, g^{p-1}\} = \{0, 1, 1+1, \cdots, p-1\}$

The discrete log problem in this group is easy:
* Given $h \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, we want to find $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $g^\alpha = h$
* But since the operation is addition, $g^\alpha = \alpha \cdot g = \alpha$ since $g = 1$
* So trivially, $\alpha = h$

The D-H function in this group is also trivial to compute:
$$
\text{DH}_1(3,5) = g^{3} \cdot g^{5} = 3 \cdot 5 = 15
$$

### Example: Multiplicative Group
* Let $G = \mathbb{Z}_{11}^*$$ where the group operation is multiplication modulo $11$
* The generator of this group is $g = 2$ because we can create this table showing all elements:
$$
\begin{array}{c|cccccc}
n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
\text{Dlog}_2(n) & 0 & 1 & 8 & 2 & 4 & 9 \\
\hline
\text{Value} & 2^0 = 1 & 2^1 = 2 & 2^8 \bmod 11 = 3 & 2^2 = 4 & 2^4 \bmod 11 = 5 & 2^9 \bmod 11 = 6 \\
\end{array}
$$

The discrete log problem in this group is hard:
* Given $h \in \mathbb{Z}_{11}^*$, we want to find $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{10}$ such that $2^\alpha \equiv h \bmod 11$
* For example, if $h = 9$, then $\alpha = 6$ because $2^6 \equiv 9 \bmod 11$
* But finding this $\alpha$ requires trying different exponents or using more sophisticated algorithms

## Discrete Log and CDH
**Fact**: If the discrete log problem is easy, then the CDH problem is easy
* Given $(g, g^\alpha, g^\beta)$, use DLog to find $\beta$ using $(g, g^\beta)$ and then compute $(g^\alpha)^\beta$

**Security of CDH**: If the CDH problem is easy, then discrete log is easy. This implies that if the discrete log is hard, then the CDH problem is hard.
* Proving this for arbitrary groups is still an open problem.

# Interactive vs. Non-Interactive
TLS is an interactive protocol ⟶ parties do a key exchange then use the key to communicate securely
![Pasted image 20250226112051](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226112051.png)

iMessage is a non-interactive protocol ⟶ parties may not be online at the same time, preventing them from doing a key exchange
* **Goal**: Use a central trusted party (e.g. iCloud) to store the ciphertext to forward to the other party
* **Important**: This central party can only see the ciphertext, so it's end-to-end encrypted
* **Solution**: Use a public key infrastructure where each party has a public key and a secret key
	* Sender encrypts using the public key, receiver decrypts using their secret key
	* The public keys are sent in advance to iCloud which stores it.

# Public Key Encryption
Asymmetric Encryption: Encryption is done using a public key, decryption is done using a secret key
![Pasted image 20250226112528](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226112528.png)

A PKE scheme over $(M, C)$ is a triple of algorithms $(\text{Gen}, E, D)$ where:
* $\text{Gen}$ is a probabilistic key generation algorithm that outputs a pair of keys $(pk, sk)$
* $E(pk, m)$ outputs a ciphertext $c \in C$
* $D(sk, c)$ outputs a message $m \in M$ or $\text{reject}$ if $c$ is invalid
such that if $(pk, sk) \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} \text{Gen}$ and $m \in M$, then $D(sk, E(pk, m)) = m$ with probability $1$

## Semantic Security
Security against **eavesdroppers** ⟶ ciphertext reveals no information about the plaintext
![Pasted image 20250226113127](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226113127.png)
**Def**: $(\text{Gen}, E, D)$ is semantically secure if for all efficient adversaries $A$
$$
\text{Adv}_\text{SS}[A, (\text{Gen}, E, D)] = \left| \Pr[\text{EXP}(0) \rightarrow 1] - \Pr[\text{EXP}(1) \rightarrow 1] \right| \leq \text{negl}
$$
**Fact 1**: If the PKE scheme is semantically secure, then $E$ must be a randomized encryption scheme
* Since $A$ knows the public key, if $E$ was deterministic, then $A$ could encrypt $m$ on its own and compare that with the ciphertext it gets back from the challenge

## Applications of PKE

**Key Exchange** ⟶ use PKE to exchange keys that is secure against eavesdroppers
* Security: $E$ sees $pk, E(pk, k)$ ⟶ if the PKE is semantically secure, the ciphertext reveals nothing about $k$
* The adversary cannot distinguish between $pk, E(pk, k)$ and $pk, E(pk, 0)$ ⟶ learns nothing about $k$
* **Important**: This is not secure against MITM attacks for same reason that DH is insecure against it

**File Sharing** ⟶ use PKE to share files in an encrypted file system without having to communicate live
* The file is encrypted under a file encryption key $k_1$ ⟶ encryption $E_s(k_1, F)$ stored in the cloud
* The key is encrypted under Alice's personal key $k_a$ ⟶ encryption $E_s(k_a, k_1)$ stored in cloud metadata
![Pasted image 20250226114725](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226114725.png)
* If Alice wants to share $F_1$ with Bob (but not $F_2$), she can encrypt $k_1$ with Bob's public key

# Constructing PKE: ElGamal

**Key Ingredients**:
* $G$: a finite cyclic group of prime order $q$ with generator $g \in G$
* $(E_s, D_s)$: a symmetric cipher defined over $(K, M, C)$
* $H: G^2 \rightarrow K$: a hash function going from the group to the key space
![Pasted image 20250227121137](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250227121137.png)

**Key Generation**:
* Generate a random element $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ and set $h := g^\alpha \in G$
* Output $(pk, sk) = (h, \alpha)$
* **Important**: if the DLog is hard, then there is no way to recover the secret key $\alpha$ from the public key $h$
![Pasted image 20250226120144](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226120144.png)

**Encryption** $E(pk := h, m)$:
* Generate a random element $\beta \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ and compute $u := g^\beta$ and $v := h^\beta (= g^{\alpha \beta})$
* Generate a symmetric key $k := H(u, v) \in K$ ⟶ a key derived from the DH secret
* Encrypt $m$ under $k$ to get $c := E_s(k, m)$
* Output the ciphertext $(u, c)$

![Pasted image 20250226120208](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250226120208.png)

**Decryption** $D(sk := \alpha, (u, c))$:
* Compute $v := u^\alpha (= g^{\alpha \beta})$
* Compute $k := H(u, v)$
* Output $m := D_s(k, c)$

**Other Details**
* **Performance**: Encryption requires 2 exponentiations in $G$ and decryption requires 1 exponentiation in $G$
* **Standard**: The standard construction of ElGamal is ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme)

## El Gamal Security

**Theorem 1**: ElGamal $(\text{Gen}, E, D)$ is semantically secure assuming:
1. CDH holds in the finite cyclic group $(G, g)$
2. The symmetric cipher $(E_s, D_s)$ is semantically secure
3. The hash function $H$ is a "random oracle" ⟶ $H$ behaves like a random function

**Theorem 2**: ElGamal $(\text{Gen}, E, D)$ is CCA secure (against tampering) assuming:
1. Interactive Diffie-Hellman assumption holds in $(G, g)$
2. The symmetric cipher $(E_s, D_s)$ provides authenticated encryption (CPA and ciphertext integrity)
3. The hash function $H$ is a "random oracle" ⟶ $H$ behaves like a random function
