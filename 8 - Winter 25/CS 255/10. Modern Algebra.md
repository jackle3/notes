# Recap
* **Current goal**: design a key exchange scheme that is secure against eavesdropping!
* **Diffie-Hellman**:
	* This works because $g^{ab} = g^{ba}$, so we can send $g^a$ and $g^b$ separately and compute the shared key $g^{ab}$
	* There was also a $\bmod p$ to make the discrete log problem harder. It works because:
		* $\big[ (g^a) \bmod p \big]^b \bmod p = g^{ab} \bmod p$ ⟶ the mod commutes with exponentiation

# Arithmetic mod P
* On a 32-bit computer, large numbers are stored in multiple "limbs":
	* An $n$-bit number is split into $\lceil n/32 \rceil$ chunks of 32 bits each (called limbs)
![[Pasted image 20250215220815.png]]
* Arithmetic operations must be performed limb by limb:
	* Addition/Subtraction: $O(n)$ time
		* Process each limb once, carrying over as needed
	* Multiplication: $O(n^2)$ time
		* Must multiply each limb with every other limb
		* Then sum up all partial products (requires $n$ $n$-bit additions)
	* Modulo: $k \bmod n$ is $O(n^2)$ time
		* Similar complexity to multiplication
	* **Note**: $n$ is the number of bits in the value. I.e. this is same as $O(\log_2 x)$ where $x$ is an $n$-bit number
* Note: if given a squaring algorithm we can construct a multiplication algorithm that is only a bit slower

# Modular Arithmetic
* Let $n$ be a very large positive integer, and let $p$ be a positive prime.
* Let $\mathbb{Z}_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ be the set of integers modulo $n$
	* This allows us to compute addition, subtraction, and multiplication modulo $n$
* Modulo $n$ means we add or subtract multiples of $n$ until the result is within $\mathbb{Z}_n$
	* Example: $11 \bmod 5 = 1$ because $11 - 5 \times 2 = 1$
	* Example: $-3 \bmod 15 = 12$ because $-3 + 15 \times 1 = 12$

## GCD Algorithm
* **Euclid's algorithm**:
	* For all integers $n, m$, there exists integers $a, b$ such that $a \cdot n + b \cdot m = \text{gcd}(n, m)$
		* For example, $\text{gcd}(12, 18) = 6$ because $2 \cdot 12 + (-1) \cdot 18 = 6$
	* $a, b$ can be found using $O(\log (n + m))$ arithmetic operations
	* If $\text{gcd}(n, m) = 1$, then $n$ and $m$ are **relatively prime**
	* **Intuition**: If $d$ divides both $n$ and $m$, then it must also divide $n - km$ for any integer $k$
		* When we divide $n$ by $m$: $n = qm + r$ (where $q$ is quotient, $r$ is remainder)
		* Rearranging: $r = n - qm$
		* Therefore: $\text{gcd}(n,m) = \text{gcd}(m,r)$
		* We can keep reducing to smaller numbers until we get a remainder of 0
		* The last non-zero remainder must be the GCD since it divides both numbers from the previous step

# Modular Exponentiation
* We want to compute $g^x \bmod p$. Use **repeated squaring** algorithm:
	1. Suppose we want to compute $g^{13}$. We can write 13 in binary as $1101_2$. This means we can write $13$ as a sum of powers of 2.
	2. This means $g^{13} = g^{1101_2} = g^8 \times g^4 \times g^1$
	3. Now, you can start with $g^1$ and keep squaring it to get $g^2, g^4, g^8, \ldots$
	4. We can then pick out the ones we want and multiply them together to get $g^{13}$.
## Repeated Squaring Algorithm
1. Let $x = x_n x_{n-1} \ldots x_1 x_0 \in \{0, 1\}^{n+1}$ be the binary representation of $x$
2. Set $z \leftarrow 1$ and $y \leftarrow g$
3. For $i$ from $0$ to $n$:
	1. If $x_i = 1$, set $z \leftarrow z \times y \bmod p$
	2. Set $y \leftarrow y^2 \bmod p$
4. Output $z$

### Runtime
* We have at most $2 \times \log_2(x)$ multiplications (for $z$ and $y$)
	* Each multiplication is $O(n^2)$ time
	* Since $x$ is an $n$-bit number, $\log_2(x) = n$
* If $x \approx p$ where $p$ is an $n$-bit prime, then:
	* Number of multiplications = $O(n)$
	* Each multiplication costs $O(n^2)$ time
	* Total runtime is $O(n^3)$

# Modular Inversion
* In rationals, the inverse of $x$ is simply $\frac{1}{x}$
* **Def**: The inverse of $x \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ is an integer $y \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ such that $x \cdot y \equiv 1 \bmod n = 1 \in \mathbb{Z}_n$
	* Note that we are in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ so we are working with integers modulo $n$

* **Ex**: Suppose $n$ is an odd integer. What is the inverse of $2$ in $\mathbb{Z}_n$?
	* We need to find $y$ such that $2 \cdot y \equiv 1 \bmod n$
	* The answer is $y = \frac{n+1}{2} \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ because $2 \cdot \frac{n+1}{2} = n+1 \equiv 1 \bmod n$

* **Which elements in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ have an inverse?**
	* **Lemma**: $x \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ has an inverse iff $\text{gcd}(x, n) = 1$
	* **Proof**:
		* Forwards: Suppose $gcd(x, n) = 1$. That means there exists integers $a, b$ such that $a \cdot x + b \cdot n = 1$
			* We reduce that modulo $n$ (subtract multiples of $n$ until result is in $\mathbb{Z}_n$).
				* That gives us $a \cdot x \equiv 1 \bmod n$
				* Therefore, $a$ is the inverse of $x$ modulo $n$
		* Backwards (contrapositive): If $\text{gcd}(x, n) > 1$, then $x$ cannot have an inverse
			* Let $d = \text{gcd}(x, n) > 1$. Then $a \cdot x + b \cdot n = d$ for some integers $a, b$
			* Reducing modulo $n$, we get $a \cdot x \equiv d \bmod n$
			* Since $d > 1$, this means $a \cdot x \bmod n$ can never equal $1$
			* Therefore, no value of $a$ can be an inverse of $x$

## Set of Invertible Elements
* Let $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ be the set of elements in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ that have an inverse.
$$
\mathbb{Z}_n^* = \{0 < x < n \mid \text{gcd}(x, n) = 1\}
$$
* For example:
	* For a prime number, the set of invertible elements is $\mathbb{Z}_p^* = \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\} = \mathbb{Z}_p \setminus \{0\}$
		* This is because all numbers less than $p$ have a gcd of 1 with $p$
	* For $n = 12$, we have $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^* = \{1, 5, 7, 11\}$

## Finding an Inverse with GCD
* We can use Euclid's algorithm to find the inverse of an element in $\mathbb{Z}_n$
* For $x \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$, we can find the inverse of $x$ using $O(\log n)$ arithmetic operations.
	* Recall that addition and subtraction is linear in the number of bits in $n$. This means that the time for each operation is $O(\log n)$.
	* The overall runtime to find an inverse is thus $O(\log^2 n)$

# Solving Modular Linear Equations
* Suppose we want to solve $a \cdot x + b = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ ⟶ The answer is $x = -b \cdot a^{-1} \in \mathbb{Z}_n$
	* We just treat all our arithmetic operations as modulo $n$.
	* This will take $O(\log^2 n)$ time because we need to compute the inverse of $a$
* We can also solve a system of linear equations by running Gaussian elimination modulo $n$

# Fermat's Theorem
* **Fermat's Little Theorem (1640)**: Let $p$ be a prime. For every element $x \in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$, we have $x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p$
	* Ex: $p = 5$ ⟶ let $x = 3 \in \mathbb{Z}_5^*$ ⟶ $3^{5 - 1} = 81 \equiv 1 \bmod 5$

## Applications of Fermat's Theorem
* **Calculating Large Powers Modulo Primes**:
	* We can use Fermat's theorem to reduce the exponent modulo $p-1$
	* Ex: Calculate $11^{301} \bmod 101$
		* $101$ is prime ⟶ $11^{100} \equiv 1 \bmod 101$
		* $301 = 100 \cdot 3 + 1$ ⟶ $11^{301} = 11^{100 \cdot 3 + 1} = (11^{100})^3 \cdot 11 \equiv 1^3 \cdot 11 \equiv 11 \in \mathbb{Z}_{101}^*$
	* Ex: Calculate $3^{2025} \bmod 11$
		* $11$ is prime ⟶ $3^{10} \equiv 1 \bmod 11$
		* $2025 = 10 \cdot 202 + 5$ ⟶ $3^{2025} = 3^{10 \cdot 202 + 5} = (3^{10})^{202} \cdot 3^5 \equiv 1^{202} \cdot 3^5 \equiv 3^5 \bmod 11$
		* $3^5 = 243 \equiv 1 \bmod 11$

* **Finding an Inverse**:
	* Given $x \in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$, we know that $x^{p-1} = x \cdot x^{p - 2}$ is equal to $1 \in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$
	* Therefore, $x^{p-2}$ is the inverse of $x$ modulo $p$ ($x \in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$)
	* Using this method, we can find the inverse in $O(\log^3 p)$ (exponentiation is cubic in the number of bits in $p$)

* **Generating a Probable Prime**:
	* Repeatedly choose a random $p$ from the set of 2048-bit integers $\{ 2^{2047}, \ldots, 2^{2048} - 1 \}$
	* If $2^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p$, then output $p$ as a probable prime and end the loop
	* The probability that $p$ is not prime but passes this test is very small

# Structure of $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$
* **Euler's Lemma**: If $p$ is a prime, then $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ is a cyclic group. This means there exists a number $g \in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$ such that every element of $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ can be written as $g^k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$
$$
\exists g \in \mathbb{Z}_p^* \quad \text{ s.t. } \quad \{1, g, g^2, \ldots, g^{p-2}\} = \mathbb{Z}_p^*
$$
* Such a $g$ is called a **generator** of $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$

* Ex: $p = 7$ ⟶ $\mathbb{Z}_7^* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. $g = 3$ is a generator because
$$
\{1, 3, 3^2 = 9 \equiv 2 \bmod 7, 3^3 = 27 \equiv 6 \bmod 7, 3^4 = 81 \equiv 4 \bmod 7, 3^5 = 243 \equiv 5 \bmod 7\} = \mathbb{Z}_7^*
$$

## Cyclic Groups
* In general, a finite cyclic group is a pair $(G, \cdot)$ where $G$ is a finite set and $\cdot: G \times G \to G$ is a multiplication operation that satisfies:
	* **Identity**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that $e \cdot g = g \cdot e = g$ for all $g \in G$
	* **Inverse**: For each $g \in G$, there exists an element $g^{-1} \in G$ such that $g \cdot g^{-1} = g^{-1} \cdot g = e$
	* **Associative**: $(g \cdot h) \cdot k = g \cdot (h \cdot k)$ for all $g, h, k \in G$
	* **Commutative**: $g \cdot h = h \cdot g$ for all $g, h \in G$
	* **Generator**: There exists a generator $g \in G$ such that $G = \{g^0, g^1, g^2, \ldots\}$
* $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ is an example of a finite cyclic group.

## Order of an Element
* For an element $h \in G$, the **order** of $h$ is the size of the subgroup generated by $h$.
$$
\text{order}(h) = \left| \{h^0, h^1, \ldots\} \subseteq G \right|
$$
* Ex: in $\mathbb{Z}_7^*$, we have $\text{order}(3) = 6$ and $\text{order}(2) = 3$

## Important Properties
* **Fact 1**: For every element $g \in G$, we have $g^{\text{order}(g)} = 1$
* **Fact 2 (Lagrange's Theorem)**: For all $g \in G$, the $\text{order}(g)$ divides $|G|$

# Computing Roots
* Suppose $G$ is a finite cyclic group of known prime order $q$ with generator $g \in G$.
* **Problem**: Given $h \in G$ and an integer exponent $1 < e < q$, find $y = h^{1/e}$ (i.e. find $y$ such that $y^e = h$)

## Main Algorithm
* **Solution**:
	1. Compute $\alpha := (e^{-1} \bmod q) \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ ⟶ this inverse exists because $q$ is prime and $e \neq 0$
	3. Output $y := h^\alpha \in G$

## Explanation
* **Why does this work?**
	* We know that $\alpha \cdot e \equiv 1 \in \mathbb{Z}_q$
	* This means there exists an integer $k$ such that $\alpha \cdot e = 1 + k \cdot q$
$$
\begin{align*}
y^e &= (h^\alpha)^e \\
&= h^{1 + k \cdot q} \tag{because $\alpha$ is inverse of $e$ modulo $q$}\\
&= h \cdot (h^q)^k \\
&= h \cdot 1^k \tag{using Fact 1 where $q$ is order of group} \\
&= h \tag{desired result where $y^e = h$}
\end{align*}
$$
	* Since $y^e = h$, this means that $h^{1/e} = y$. We've computed the $e$th root of $h$!
	* We can use the same idea to compute square roots, cube roots, etc.

## Example: Square Roots
* Ex. to compute $\sqrt{h} = h^{1/2}$
	1. Compute $\alpha := (2^{-1} \bmod q) \in \mathbb{Z}_q$
		* Notice that $\alpha = \frac{q+1}{2}$ because $2 \cdot \alpha = 2 \cdot \frac{q+1}{2} = q+1 \equiv 1 \bmod q$
	2. Output $y := h^\alpha \in G$
	3. Observe that $y^2 = (h^\alpha)^2 = h^{2 \cdot \alpha} = h^{1 + k \cdot q} = h \cdot (h^q)^k = h \cdot 1^k = h$

# Diffie-Hellman in a Finite Cyclic Group
* Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group of order $q$ with generator $g \in G$
* **Problem**: Alice and Bob want to securely exchange a secret key
	* The parameters are $(G, g, q)$ and we want to compute a shared key $K = g^{\alpha \cdot \beta} \in G$
	* The adversary sees $g$, $g^\alpha$, and $g^\beta$
![[Pasted image 20250223150623.png]]

* **Def**: The computational Diffie-Hellman assumption (CDH) holds in $(G, g)$ if:
	* For every efficient adversary $A$, the probability of $A$ outputting $g^{\alpha \cdot \beta}$ given $g$, $g^\alpha$, and $g^\beta$ is negligible when $\alpha, \beta$ are chosen randomly from $\mathbb{Z}_q$

* As long as this assumption holds, the Diffie-Hellman protocol is secure. We now need to choose groups $G$ that satisfy this.
	* Ex: $G = \mathbb{Z}_p^*$ is a finite cyclic group of prime order $p$
		* The best CDH algorithm to break DH runs in time $e^{(\log p)^{1/3}}$
		* This means $p$ must be at least $2048$ bits to be secure

	* Ex: Elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Z}_p$
		* The best known CDH algorithm to break DH runs in time $\sqrt{p} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} \log p}$
		* This means $p$ must only be $256$ bits to be secure

# Elliptic Curve Groups over $\mathbb{Z}_p$
## Diophantus (200 AD)
* Diophantus asked "Can we find rationals $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $y^2 = x^3 - x + 9$?"
	* The important thing is that $x$ is raised to the power of 3
* There are a few integer solutions:
	* Ex: $(0, \pm 3)$ is a solution because $3^2 = 0^3 - 0 + 9$
	* Ex: $(\pm 1, \pm 3)$ is a solution because $3^2 = 1^3 - 1 + 9$
* Can we find rational solutions?

## Poincare (1900)
* Consider $P \boxplus Q \triangleq R$ ⟶ this is an associative group
	* Take two points $P$ and $Q$ and find the third intersection point, then reflect it. This is $R$.
![[Pasted image 20250223151958.png]]

## Hasse (1933)
* Let $E(G)$ denote the elliptic curve group over a finite field $G$
* This group $\bmod p$ has size:
$$
p - 2 \sqrt{p} + 1 \leq |E(\mathbb{Z}_p)| \leq p + 2 \sqrt{p} + 1
$$
* This means that the size of the group is $O(\sqrt{p})$

* **Important**: The best known CDH algorithm to break $E(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ runs in time $O(\sqrt{p})$
	* For $128$-bit security, we only need $p$ to be $256$ bits

## Curve 25519
* This is kind of the standard curve used for elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
* The equation is:
$$y^2 = (x^3 + 486662x^2 + x) \bmod (2^{255} - 19)$$
