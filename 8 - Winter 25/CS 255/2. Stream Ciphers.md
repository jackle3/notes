# Recap
- A cipher defined over $(K, M, C)$ is a pair of efficient algorithms $(E, D)$ such that
$$
\forall k \in K, \forall m \in M, \exists c \in C: D(k, E(k, m)) = m
$$

## Weak Ciphers
- The substitution cipher was a weak cipher since we could break it with a ciphertext only attack using frequency analysis.

## Good Ciphers
- The OTP is a good cipher since it was perfectly secure.
- OTP was defined over $(K, M, C)$ where $K = M = C = \{0,1\}^n$
- Encryption: $E(k, m) = k \oplus m$
- Decryption: $D(k, c) = k \oplus c$

## Perfect Secrecy (Shannon)
- A cipher `(E, D)` over $(K, M, C)$ has **perfect secrecy** if
$$
\begin{align*}
&\forall m_{0}, m_{1} \in M \quad \text{where } \text{len}(m_{0}) = \text{len}(m_{1}), \\
&\forall c \in C. \\
&Pr[E(k, m_{0}) = c] = Pr[E(k, m_{1}) = c]
\end{align*}
$$
- In other words, ciphers have perfect secrecy if the ciphertext is independent of the plaintext. An adversary that sees **a single ciphertext** cannot learn anything about the plaintext when $k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} K$.

## Theorem (OTP)
- The OTP has perfect secrecy (if the key is random and used only once)
- This means there is no ciphertext-only attack that can break the OTP.
### Two-Time Pad
- The two-time pad is insecure. To see this, consider the following:
$$
\begin{align*}
c_1 \leftarrow k \oplus m_1 \\
c_2 \leftarrow k \oplus m_2
\end{align*}
$$
- If an adversary intercepts $c_1$ and $c_2$, they can compute:
$$
c_1 \oplus c_2 = (k \oplus m_1) \oplus (k \oplus m_2) = m_1 \oplus m_2
$$
- Using redundancy and frequency analysis, the adversary can easily recover $m_1$ and $m_2$.
### Theorem (bad news)
- If a cipher has perfect secrecy, then $|K| \geq |M|$
- This means that the OTP is optimal - we cannot do better than using keys as long as messages.

# Stream Ciphers
- Main question: how to make the ideas from OTP practical?
- Idea: use a short key $k$ to generate a pseudo-random key
## Def: PRG
- The pseudorandom generator is a function $G: \{0,1\}^s \to \{0,1\}^{n}$ where $n >> s$ and $G$ is efficiently computable by a deterministic algorithm.
	- The input of $G$ is the seed, and the output is the pseudo-random key.
## Def: Stream Cipher
- The stream cipher is a cipher defined over $(K, M, C)$ where $K = \{0,1\}^s$, $M = C = \{0,1\}^n$ for some $n >> s$.
- Encryption: $E(k, m) = G(k) \oplus m$
- Decryption: $D(k, c) = G(k) \oplus c$

- **Important:** The stream cipher does not have perfect secrecy because the seed is much shorter than the message.
	- $|K| << |M|$

# Psueodorandom Generators
- We can no longer use perfect secrecy to define security; we'll need a new definition.
- **Idea:** Security now depends on the safety of the PRG.
- **Main Question:** How do we build a PRG such that when we use it in a stream cipher, we end up with a secure cipher?

## Bad PRG
- Let $X = \{0,1\}^s$ be the seed space of the PRG.
- Consider a bad PRG $G: X \to X^n$ that is not secure.
	- This generator takes as input an $s$-bit seed and outputs an $s * n$ bit string.
	- $G(k) = (k, k, \dots, k) \in X^n$
	- When $k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} X$, $G(k)$ does not "look random" because we can **distinguish** the output of $G(k)$ from a random string.

### Distinguisher
- Consider an adversary $A: y \in X^n \to \{0,1\}$:
```
if y[0] == y[1]:
	return 0 (meaning y is pseudorandom)
else:
	return 1 (meaning y is random)
```
- When $k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} X$ and $r \leftarrow G(k)$, we have:
$$
\begin{align*}
Pr[A(r) = 1] &= 0 \tag{bc every element of $r$ is same}\\
\end{align*}
$$
- When $r \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} X^n$, we need to subtract the probability that two $s$-bit strings next to each other are the same:
$$
\begin{align*}
Pr[A(r) = 1] &= 1 - \frac{1}{2^s} \tag{because $r$ is random}
\end{align*}
$$
- Therefore, $A$ can distinguish between the output of a pseudorandom string $G(k)$ and a random string.

### Advantage
**Definition:** The advantage of $A$ attacking a PRG $G: X \to Y$ is:
$$
\text{Adv}[A, G] := \left| Pr \left[\substack{k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} X \\ r \leftarrow G(k)} : A(r) = 1\right] -Pr[r \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} Y : A(r) = 1] \right|
$$
- First term is the probability if we choose our key $k$ at random, and we define $r$ as the the output of the generator $G(k)$, the chance that $A$ will output 1.
	- In other words $r$ is the pseudorandom output of $G(k)$ and $A$ thinks it is random
- Second term is the probability if we choose $r$ at random, the chance that $A$ will output 1.
	- In other words $r$ is a truly random output and $A$ thinks it is random
- The advantage describes whether $A$ can distinguish between the output of $G(k)$ and a random string.
- In the previous example, the advantage is $|0 - (1 - \frac{1}{2^s})| = 1 - \frac{1}{2^s} \approx 1$.
	- If the advantage is close to 1, that means $A$ broke the PRG $G$.
	- If the advantage is close to 0, then $A$ fails to distinguish random from pseudorandom on the PRG.

### Semantic Security
- A PRG $G: X \to Y$ is **semantically secure** if for every efficient adversary $A$, we have:
$$
\text{Adv}[A, G] \leq \epsilon \tag{$\epsilon$ is negligible}
$$
- This means that $A$ cannot distinguish between the output of $G(k)$ and a random string.
- Similarly, a cipher $(E, D)$ is semantically secure if for every efficient adversary $A$, we have:
$$
\text{Adv}[A, (E, D)] \leq \epsilon \tag{$\epsilon$ is negligible}
$$
- This means that $A$ cannot distinguish between the output of $E(k, m)$ and a random string.

## Secure PRG
- A PRG $G: X \to Y$ is **secure** if for every efficient adversary $A$, we have:
$$
\text{Adv}[A, G] \leq \epsilon \tag{$\epsilon$ is negligible}
$$
- **Note:** This definition of a secure PRG cannot be satisfied in an unbounded adversary.
	- Suppose the adversary was already given some input $r \in Y$.
	- An unbounded adversary can try every possible seed and check whether applying $G$ to that seed gives the same $r$.

### Visualization
- Consider a PRG $G: X \to Y$.
	- A uniformly random generator is a uniform distribution over $Y$
	- A PRG is a deterministic function that samples from a small subspace of $Y$
	- The PRG is secure if the output of the PRG is indistinguishable from a uniformly random generator.

### Indistinguishability
- Every efficient adversary $A$ behaves the same on:
	- truly random inputs $\{ r \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} Y \}$
	- and pseudorandom inputs $\{ r \leftarrow G(k) \}$ for $k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} X$
- This means if we choose a random seed $k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} X$, we can treat the output of the PRG $G(k)$ as if $G(k)$ were truly random.

## Theorem (Stream Cipher)
- If the PRG $G$ is secure, then the derived stream cipher $(E, D)$ is semantically secure.

## Unpredictability
- We say that $G: \{0,1\}^s \to \{0,1\}^n$ is **predictable** if there exists an efficient adversary $A$ and $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ such that:
$$
Pr \left[ \substack{k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} \{0,1\}^s \\ r \leftarrow G(k)} : A(r[0:i-1]) = r[i) \right] = 1 \tag{condition of predictability}
$$
- In other words, $G$ is predictable if there exists an efficient adversary $A$ that can predict the $i$-th bit of $r$ given the first $i-1$ bits of $r$.
- Example: our bad generator $G(k) = (k, k, \dots, k)$ is predictable.
- **Important:** If $G$ is predictable, then $G$ is not secure, meaning the derived stream cipher is not secure.
	- Suppose adversary intercepts ciphertext $c$.
	- **Common fact:** all messages start with the same prefix (e.g. "`https://`").
	- Adversary can xor prefix of the ciphertext with the known message prefix to get the prefix of the key.
	- Since generator is predictable, adversary can use the prefix of key to predict the next bit of key.
	- This means the adversary can predict the entire key, and so the ciphertext is not secure.

### Theorem (Predictability)
- If the PRG $G$ is secure, then $G$ is not predictable.
	- This also means that if $G$ is predictable, then $G$ is not secure.
- **Proof (by contrapositive):**
	- Suppose there is some algorithm that can predict $G$. Then there exists an efficient adversary $A$ and position $i$ such that:
$$
	Pr \left[ \substack{k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} \{0,1\}^s \\ r \leftarrow G(k)} : A(r[0:i-1]) = r[i] \right] = 1
$$
	- We can construct an adversary $B$ that breaks the security of $G$:
		1. Given input $r$, run $A(r[0:i-1])$ to get prediction $b \in \{0,1\}$
		2. If $b == r[i]$, output 0 (not random).
		3. Otherwise output 1 (random).
	- When $r$ is pseudorandom:
		- $B$ outputs 1 with probability 0 (by assumption that $A$ predicts correctly)
	- When $r$ is random:
		- $B$ outputs 1 with probability 1/2 (since $r[i]$ is random)
	- Therefore:
	$$
	\text{Adv}[B,G] = |0 - \frac{1}{2}| = \frac{1}{2}
	$$
	- This is not negligible, so $G$ is not secure.
- This is an example of a **reduction**: we were given algorithm $A$ which was a predictor, and used it to construct algorithm $B$ which was a distinguisher.

# Example Secure PRG
## Bad PRGs
1. The `rand()` function in `glibc` is predictable, meaning it is not secure.
2. The `Math.random()` function in Java is predictable, meaning it is not secure.

## Good PRG (ChaCha20)
- This PRG is deployed on Android phones.
- Main properties:
	- It is a secure PRG.
	- It is fast on 64-bit processors.

- The key ingredients are a fixed permutation $\pi$ and the pad function $\text{pad}$.

- It uses a fixed one-to-one function $\pi: \{0,1\}^{512} \to \{0,1\}^{512}$
	- Also known as a permutation (a function where domain and range are the same)
	- Recall that 512 bits is 64 bytes.

- The key is 256 bits or 32 bytes $k \in \{0,1\}^{256}$
- Consider $j \in \{0, 1, \dots, 2^{64} - 1\}$ (this is 64 bits)
	- The **pad function** $\text{pad}(k, j) \to \{0,1\}^{512}$ stretches the (256 + 64) bits into 512 bits.

- The PRG is defined as:
	- This allows us to create a key up to $512 * 2^{64}$ bits long.
![[Pasted image 20250109164059.png]]

- Can we prove that this is a secure PRG?
	- Answer: we currently cannot prove that any specific PRG is secure because $P \neq NP$.
	- If $P = NP$, that implies that PRGs do not exist and that every PRG can be broken.

# Attacks on OTP & Stream Ciphers
## Two-Time Pad Attack
- Never use a stream cipher key more than once
- Example mistake: MS-PPTP protocol
	- Client and server would use same key k to encrypt messages in both directions
	- If m1, m2 are messages and c1, c2 are ciphertexts:
		- c1 = m1 ⊕ G(k)
		- c2 = m2 ⊕ G(k)
	- This allows an attacker to compute:
		- c1 ⊕ c2 = (m1 ⊕ G(k)) ⊕ (m2 ⊕ G(k)) = m1 ⊕ m2
	- The G(k) terms cancel out, revealing relationship between plaintexts
- This vulnerability was also present in 802.11b WEP

## No Integrity
- Stream ciphers provide no integrity protection
- Example attack scenario:
	- Alice sends encrypted payment "Pay Bob $100" to bank
	- Eve can intercept and modify ciphertext without knowing key
	- By flipping bits in ciphertext, Eve can change plaintext
	- Bank has no way to detect tampering
	- Real example: Eve could change payment amount or recipient
