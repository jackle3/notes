If a CA issues a cert for `bank` to an adversary, the adversary can impersonate `bank` to the users.
* When the user requests the bank's cert, the adversary is person-in-the-middle and sends their own cert instead

# Identification Protocols
Goal: allow user to access a resource by proving their identity to the server.
* There is an algorithm $G$ that can generate a secret key $sk$ and a verification key $vk$, and securely distribute them to the user and the server
* The server can use $vk$ to verify the user's proof of identity
* **Important**: there is no key exchange right now. Assume $G$ can distribute $sk$ and $vk$ securely.

## Applications: Internet
When talking to a server, we have two steps:
1. One-sided **authenticated** key exchange: allows user to ensure they are talking to the legitimate server
2. Identification protocol: allows server to ensure the user is legitimate

**Important Note**: ID protocol do not establish a secure session between Alice and Bob !!
* Not even when combined with **anonymous** key exchange, which is vulnerable to MITM attacks
* Vulnerable to man in to the middle attacks

# Security Models
Under identification protocols, there are three main forms of attackers to consider.
![Pasted image 20250308164422](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308164422.png)

# 1. Direct Attacks
## Plaintext Password Protocol (Bad)
1. Suppose we had $\text{PWD}$ a finite set of passwords.
2. When generating the key pair, the user and server agree on a password $\text{pw} \in \text{PWD}$.
3. $G$ then sets $sk = vk = \text{pw}$
![Pasted image 20250308165136](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308165136.png)

The problem is that the password is **stored in plaintext** on the server.

## Hashed Password Protocol
1. Consider $H: \text{PWD} \rightarrow X$ a one-way hash function.
	* Given $H(x)$ it is difficult to find $y$ such that $H(y) = H(x)$
2. When generating the key pair, the user and server agree on a password $\text{pw} \in \text{PWD}$.
3. $G$ then sets $sk = \text{pw}$ and $vk = H(\text{pw})$
![Pasted image 20250308165350](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308165350.png)

The problem is that weak passwords **have the same hash**. Adversary can use an offline dictionary attack.

### Offline Dictionary Attacks
Suppose attacker obtains a **single** $vk = H(\text{pw})$ from server
* **Offline** attack: hash all words in dictionary until a word $w$ is found such that $H(w) = vk$
	* Runtime is $O(|\text{Dict}|)$ to find $w$ for each password
There are off-the-shelf tools that can do this for you:
* Scans through all 7-letter passwords in a few minutes
* Scans through 360,000,000 guesses in a few seconds ⟶ will recover 23% of passwords

### Batch Offline Dictionary Attacks

## Salted and Hashed Password Protocol
We improve security by including a random **salt** in the hash: $H(s, \text{pw})$
* The secret key $sk$ is the password $\text{pw}$
* The verification key $vk$ is the tuple $(s, H(s, \text{pw}))$ where $s$ is a random salt
![Pasted image 20250308165837](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308165837.png)
To further improve, use a keyed hash function that is slow to compute
* Makes it hard for attacker to brute force guess the passwords ⟶ dictionary attacks are infeasible

# 2. Eavesdropping Attacks
The password protocol is secure against eavesdroppers because eavesdroppers know the server's $vk$
* In other words, it sees the user's password ⟶ it can then use that password to log in
* Any protocol in which the **transcript is reusable** is insecure against this model
![Pasted image 20250308170130](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308170130.png)

## One-time Passwords (private vk)
There is a shared secret key $k$ between the user and the server within the algorithm $G$.
* The user and the server have their own local $\text{counter}$ that they individually track
* On every communication, the prover generate a new $sk = (k, \text{counter})$. They send $F(sk)$
* To verify, the compute $vk = (k, \text{counter})$ and $F(vk)$ and check equality.

The verifier key $vk$ must be private because it contains the shared secret key $k$. If $vk$ was public:
* An attacker who sees $vk$ would learn $k$
* With $k$, they could generate valid one-time passwords by computing $F(k, \text{counter})$ for any counter value
* This would allow them to impersonate the legitimate user

This is different from previous protocols where $vk$ could be public (like hashed passwords) because here $vk$ contains the actual secret used to generate future authentication tokens.

## S/Key System (public vk)
![Pasted image 20250308171143](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308171143.png)
![Pasted image 20250308171207](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308171207.png)

![Pasted image 20250308171929](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308171929.png)
**Notes**:
* $vk$ can be made public, but need to regenerate new $sk$ after $n$ logins ($n \approx 10^6$)
	* S/Key allows the verification key to be public since it only reveals hashed values
	* However, since each login consumes one hash value from the chain, we can only use $n$ logins before needing to generate a new secret key
* **Theorem**: S/$\text{Key}_n$ is secure against eavesdroppers (public $vk$) provided $H$ is a one-way function on $n$-iterates.

# 3. Active Attacks
![Pasted image 20250308172149](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308172149.png)
All the protocols so far are vulnerable to active attacks.
1. **Direct attacks**: The solution was salted and hashed passwords. However, this is insecure against active attacks because an attacker can interact with the legitimate prover, learn information about their password, and use this to impersonate the prover to the server. The attacker does not need to break the hash function.
2. **Eavesdropping attacks**: The solution was one-time passwords. However, this is insecure against active attacks because an attacker who eavesdrops can simply replay the most recently seen one-time password to authenticate as the legitimate user. The server will accept this replay since it matches what it expects to see next.

To prevent active attacks, we need **challenge-response** protocols:
* The generator $G$ securely shares some $sk$ and $vk$ with the prover and the verifier
* The verifier sends random challenge $m$ to the prover, who must then respond with a value $t$
* The verifier then verifies that $t$ is a correct response to $m$

## MAC-based Challenge Response
![Pasted image 20250308172332](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308172332.png)
* **Note**: This is insecure against MITM attacks because the attacker can simply forward $m$ to the user and then forward $t$ to the server.
	* $k$ also needs to be high entropy to prevent dictionary attacks.
* **Benefits**: the challenge $m$ and the response $t$ can be quite short.
![Pasted image 20250308172352](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250308172352.png)

## Sig-based Challenge Response
We can use a digital signature scheme to generate a challenge-response protocol.
* The $sk$ can be the secret key of the signature scheme ⟶ only the prover can sign the response
* The $vk$ can be the public key of the signature scheme ⟶ the verifier can verify the response

# Summary
Identification protocols are useful when the adversary cannot interact with the prover
* In other words, useful except for when there is a MITM attack
