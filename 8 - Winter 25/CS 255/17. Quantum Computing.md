In the 1940s, we had **Recursive Languages** (Turing Machines)
* Problems that can be decided by a computer in principle, irrespective of the running time
* There are problems that no computers can solve, e.g. the Halting Problem

In the 1960s, we had **Polynomial (P) Time Algorithms**
* Problems that can be solved by computers in deterministic polynomial time
* However, there were problems that were not solvable, e.g. testing primality

In the 1980s, we had **Bounded Probabilistic Polynomial (BPP) Algorithms**
* Problems that can be solved by computers in probabilistic polynomial time
* For example, primality can be solved in randomized polynomial time but not in deterministic polynomial time
	* Note that in the 2000s, people found a deterministic polynomial time primality testing algorithm.

In the 1990s, Feynman introduced **Quantum Polynomial (QP) Time Algorithms**
* Suggested that quantum mechanics might be used to solve problems that are not solvable by classical computers
* These are still algorithms that run in polynomial time, but they use quantum mechanics to solve problems that are not solvable by classical computers
	* In 1994, Peter Shor found a quantum polynomial time algorithm for integer factorization
	* In 2001, Lov Grover found a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database in quadratic time

The goal today is to see: what can we do in QP in relation to cryptography?
* One of the first applications we found is that QP can break cryptographic primitives.

# Regular Quantum Computing
Classical particles are deterministic. Quantum particles are probabilistic.

The state of a quantum particle is captured by **the wave function** $\psi: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that maps from real numbers to complex numbers.
* The probability of finding the particle at position $x$ is given by $p(x) = |\psi(x)|^2$.
* The norm of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
* This is a probability distribution: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1$.

# Discrete Quantum Computing
In classical physics, and electron either has top spin or bottom spin ⟶ two states.
* We can think of our system as an electron with two states: qubit.

In quantum computing, represent the state of a qubit as a linear combination of basis states:
$$
\psi = \psi_0 \cdot |0\rangle + \psi_1 \cdot |1\rangle
$$
Where:
* $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are the basis states (similar to "top spin" and "bottom spin")
* $\psi_0, \psi_1 \in \mathbb{C}$ are complex amplitudes ⟶ encodes probability and phase information
* $|\psi_0|^2$ is the probability of measuring the qubit in state $|0\rangle$
* $|\psi_1|^2$ is the probability of measuring the qubit in state $|1\rangle$
* The normalization condition requires: $|\psi_0|^2 + |\psi_1|^2 = 1$

This is the discrete version of the wave function $\psi: \{0,1\} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that maps from the discrete set $\{0,1\}$ to complex numbers.

Unlike classical bits which must be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously until measured. When we measure a qubit, it collapses to either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$ with probabilities determined by $|\psi_0|^2$ and $|\psi_1|^2$ respectively.

We can think of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ as the basis vectors of a vector space. All the possible states of a qubit form a 2-dimensional vector space:
$$
\Omega = \{ \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle \mid \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}, |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1 \} = \text{span}_{\mathbb{C}} \{ |0\rangle, |1\rangle \}
$$
The quantum state of a qubit is a vector $\psi \in \Omega$.

## State Change
Quantum systems move from one state to another via a linear transformation $U: \Omega \rightarrow \Omega$ applied to our vector space $\Omega$.
* We need $|\psi|^2 = 1$ and $|U \cdot \psi|^2 = 1$ ⟶ $U$ preserves norms of vectors
* $\implies U$ must a unitary matrix ⟶ $U \cdot U^\dagger = I$ where $U^\dagger$ is the conjugate transpose of $U$ ($U^\dagger = \overline{U}^T$)
* Note that unitary is a generalization of orthogonal matrices to complex matrices

## N Particles (N q-bits)
With $N$ q-bits, where each q-bit can be in one of two states, we have $2^N$ possible states for the system.
* The system is in state $|w\rangle$ with probability $p(w) = |\psi(w)|^2$
* This forms a probability distribution over the set of all possible states under the normalization condition $\sum_{w \in \{0,1\}^N} |\psi(w)|^2 = 1$

# High Level of Quantum Computer
1. Initialize the state of qubits to some state $\psi_0$
2. Apply a sequence of basic transformations $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$ to the qubits to get the final state $\psi_n = U_n \cdots U_2 U_1 \psi_0$
3. Observe the system: the probability of observing the system in state $|w\rangle \in \{0,1\}^n$ is given by $p(w) = |\psi_n(w)|^2$

**Goal:** most of the amplitudes in $\psi_n$ are concentrated on the solution

Example: graph coloring problem
* We want to color the nodes of a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $k$ colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color
* This is a NP-complete problem ⟶ we don't have good classical algorithms for it
* We can try apply a quantum experiment such that after applying all the transformations, when you get to $\psi_n$, most of the amplitudes are concentrated on valid colorings of the graph
* When you measure the system, you get a valid coloring of the graph

Example: Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Design a quantum algorithm such that after applying all the transformations, when you get to $\psi_n$, most of the amplitudes are concentrated on the shortest path in the graph

# Shor's Algorithm (1994)
Let $f_1: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{G}$ be a periodic function. A periodic function is one where for some period $\pi$,
$$
\exists \pi \in \mathbb{Z} \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, f_1(x) = f_1(x + \pi)
$$
* E.g. $\sin(x)$ is periodic with period $2\pi$

Let $f_2: \mathbb{Z}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{G}$ be a doubly periodic function over a plane $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with two periods:
$$
\exists \vec{u}, \vec{v} \in \mathbb{Z}^2 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{Z}^2, f_2(x) = f_2(x + \vec{u}) = f_2(x + \vec{v})
$$

**Shor's algorithm:** given an *oracle* for $f_1$, there is a quantum algorithm that finds a random "short" period $\pi'$ of $f_1$ such that $\pi' = \alpha \cdot \pi$ for some $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}$ in time $O(\log |\pi|)$
* The classical algorithm for this problem runs in $O(|\pi|)$ times: iterate through all possible periods and check if $f_1(x) = f_1(x + \pi)$
* The same algorithm applies for $f_2$

## Application 1: Integer Factorization
We can use Shor's algorithm to factor integers, such as the RSA modulus $n = p \cdot q$
* Let $n = p \cdot q$ and $g \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} \mathbb{Z}_n^*$
* Define $f_1(x) := g^x \in \mathbb{Z}_n$
	* Notice that $f_1(x) = g^x \mod n$ is periodic because:
		* Let $\text{ord}(g)$ be the order of $g$ in $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$, which is the smallest positive integer $r$ such that $g^r \equiv 1 \mod n$
		* For any $x$, we have
$$
f_1(x + \text{ord}(g)) = g^{x + \text{ord}(g)} = g^x \cdot g^{\text{ord}(g)} = g^x \cdot 1 = g^x = f_1(x)
$$
		* This means $\text{ord}(g)$ is a period of $f_1$
	* By Euler's theorem, we know $g^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$ for any $g$ coprime to $n$
		* This means $\text{ord}(g)$ **must divide** $\phi(n)$ (since $\phi(n) = \text{ord}(g) \cdot k$ for some integer $k$)
		* The sequence repeats: $g^0 = 1, g^1 = g, g^2 = g^2, \ldots, g^{\text{ord}(g)} = 1, g^{\text{ord}(g)+1} = g, \ldots$
	* Therefore, $f_1$ is periodic with period equal to the order of $g$ in $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$

**Fact**: Given a multiple of $\phi(n)$, which Shor's algorithm can find, we can factor $n$

## Application 2: Discrete Log
We can break discrete log **in any group** $G$ of order $q$
* Let $g, h \in G$. Find $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ s.t. $g^\alpha = h$.
	* This solves the discrete log because $g^\alpha = h \implies \alpha = \text{DLog}_g(h)$
* Define $f_2: \mathbb{Z}_q^2 \rightarrow G$ by $f_2(x,y) := g^x \cdot h^y \in G$
	* $f_2$ is periodic with periods $q$ and $q$
	* Since $q$ is the order of $G$ and we know that for any $g \in G$, $g^q = 1$, we have
$$
f_2(x,y) = f_2(x+q,y) = f_2(x,y+q)
$$
		* Therefore $(q, 0)$ is a period and $(0, q)$ is a period
	* Also since we want $g^\alpha = h$, we know that $f_2(x, y) = f_2(x + \alpha, y - 1)$
$$
f_2(x + \alpha, y - 1) = g^{x + \alpha} \cdot h^{y - 1} = g^x \cdot g^\alpha \cdot h^{y-1} = g^x \cdot h \cdot h^{y-1} = f_2(x, y)
$$

**Shor's Algorithm:** finds a short period $(u, v)$ such that:
$$
(u, v) = a \cdot (0, q) + b \cdot (q, 0) + c \cdot (\alpha, -1)
$$
* If we take this equation and reduce it modulo $q$, we get:
	* Note that if $c = 0$, we can just resample.
$$
(u, v) = c \cdot (\alpha, -1) \mod q
$$
* This implies that:
$$
\begin{cases}
u = c \cdot \alpha \mod q \\
v = -c \mod q
\end{cases}
$$
* This means that $\alpha = -\frac{u}{v} \mod q$

# What to Do?
Many companies today are using ElGamal for their public-key cryptography
* ElGamal (lec 11) is based on the discrete log problem
* We showed that Shor's algorithm can break the discrete log problem in any group in efficient time

## **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)**
* Someone could be recording all the encrypted traffic on the internet right now, encrypted under ElGamal encryption
* They can then wait until quantum computers are available and break all of the encryptions
* Forward secrecy does not prevent HNDL ⟶ it assumes the encryption is secure now and in the future
* **Goal:** we want to be HDNL secure ⟶ need to move encryption algorithms to post-quantum cryptography

## **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
 **Goal**: replace Diffie-Hellman with something that is quantum secure
* We can then reuse the same key exchange protocols we have today, since they all depend on Diffie-Hellman

**NIST**: recently standardize a bunch of post-quantum cryptography standards
1. **Key Exchange (PKE)**: lattice-based encryption ⟶ ML-KEM-268
	* Problem: the ciphertext is much larger ⟶ the header is now 1088 bytes. In DH, the header was 32 bytes.
	* Note: the public key size is now 1184 bytes. Much bigger than before.

2. **Signatures:**
	* There are a few current schemes that are quantum secure
		* ML-DSA ⟶ modular lattice DSA
		* SLH-DSA ⟶ hash-based signatures
		* FN-DSA
	* Problem: the signatures are long. Short signature algorithms are not efficient.
