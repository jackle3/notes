# Recap
Public key encryption is a triple of algorithms $(\text{Gen}, E, D)$
1. ElGamal encryption: security was based on the hardness of the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem
2. Trapdoor functions with RSA: security based on the fact that TDFs are one-way
3. Later on: lattice based PKE ⟶ secure against quantum attacks

# One-way Functions
The primary concept so far is **one-way functions**: a function that is easy to compute but hard to invert.
* A one-way function $f: X \to Y$ is a function such that:
	1. There exists an efficient algorithm to compute $f$
	2. For all efficient adversaries $A$, the probability of $A$ computing a preimage of $f$ is negligible.
$$
\text{Pr}[f(A(f(x))) = f(x)] \text{ is negligible}
$$
* In other words, given $y = f(x)$, it is hard to find $x' = A(y)$ such that $f(x') = y$

## Examples of OWFs
**Type 1**: General one-way functions ⟶ these don't have any specific properties
* Let $(E, D)$ be a secure cipher. The following is a one-way function:
$$
F^E(k) := (E(k, 0), E(k, 1), \ldots, E(k, n))
$$
* If there is no ciphertext-only attack, then $F^E$ is a one-way function because:
	1. Easy to compute $F^E(k)$
	2. Hard to invert $F^E(k)$ because the cipher is secure. We are basically given a bunch of ciphertexts and we need to find the key $k$.
* This is bad for key exchange because **there is no way to efficiently invert it**.
	* Note: RSA TDF works because even though $F$ is one-way, we have the trapdoor $F^{-1}$ to invert it if we know the secret key.

**Type 2**: $G$ is a finite cyclic group with order $q$ and generator $g \in G$
* The function $F^{\text{DLog}}: \mathbb{Z}_q^* \to G$ is a one-way function if discrete log is hard in the group $G$:
$$
F^{\text{DLog}}(x) := g^x \in G
$$
	* Recall that the order of a group is defined as the number of elements in the group.
	* Recall that the discrete log problem is: given $g^x \in G$, find $x \in \mathbb{Z}_q$.
* Properties of $F^{\text{DLog}}$ that enable Diffie-Hellman key exchange:
	1. Inversion this function is solving the discrete log problem.
	2. Computing $F(x + y) = g^{x + y} = g^x g^y = F(x) \cdot F(y)$ is easy.
	3. Computing $F(x)^c = (g^x)^c = g^{cx} = F(x \cdot c)$ is easy.

**Type 3**: RSA where $n = p \cdot q$ and $e \in \mathbb{Z}_{\phi(n)}^*$ is relatively prime to $\phi(n)$
* The function $F^{\text{RSA}}: \mathbb{Z}_n^* \to \mathbb{Z}_n^*$ is a one-way function if RSA is hard to invert.
$$
F^{\text{RSA}}(x) := x^e \mod n
$$
	* Recall that $\phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)$ is the size of $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ (set of numbers in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ relatively prime to $n$)
	* Recall that $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ is where messages and ciphertexts live
	* Recall that $\mathbb{Z}_{\phi(n)}^*$ is where the exponents $e$ and $d$ live
* Properties of $F^{\text{RSA}}$:
	1. Inversion this function is solving the RSA assumption: given $y = x^e \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$, it is hard to find $x$
	2. Computing $F(x + y) = (x + y)^e = F(x) \cdot F(y)$ is easy.
	3. There exists a trapdoor: given $d = e^{-1} \mod \phi(n)$, we can invert $F$ by computing $F(y)^d \mod n$
* These properties imply security in RSA-based encryption and RSA-based digital signatures.

# Digital Signatures
A signature scheme is triple of algorithms $(\text{Gen},\text{Sign}, \text{Verify})$ such that:
* $\text{Gen}$ outputs a key pair $(sk, pk)$
* $\text{Sign}(sk, m \in M)$ outputs a signature $\sigma$ on $m$
* $\text{Verify}(pk, m, \sigma)$ is a deterministic algorithm that outputs $\text{yes}$ if $\sigma$ is a valid signature on $m$ under $pk$, and $\text{no}$ otherwise
where if $(pk, sk) \leftarrow \text{Gen}()$, then $\text{Verify}(pk, m, \text{Sign}(sk, m)) = \text{yes}$ for all $m \in M$

## Security of Digital Signatures
Allow the attacker to perform a **chosen message attack** on the signature scheme.
1. The attacker can request signatures on arbitrary messages
2. The attacker should create an existential forgery: a valid signature $\sigma$ on an **unqueried** message $m$
	* Note that it is not an attack if the adversary forges a different signature on a queried message $m$

## Applications of Digital Signatures
1. Software updates: updates come signed with a signature from the developer. Your device verifies this signature before installing the update.
2. Certificates: a way for a third party (i.e. certificate authority) to vouch for the authenticity of a public key.
3. Payments: credit cards have a chip with a secret key built in. When you swipe your card, the PoS terminal sends the transaction to the card, the card signs it and sends it back to the terminal. The terminal can send this transaction and signature to the card company to verify the transaction.

# Approaches to Data Integrity
1. Collision-resistant hash functions: using a **read-only public space** for hashes. When you download a file, you can check the hash against the public space to ensure integrity.
2. Digital signatures: **one signer** (with sk) signs the data; **many verifiers** (with pk).
3. MAC: **one signer** (with symmetric key $k$) signs the data; **one verifier** (with symmetric key $k$).

# Constructing Digital Signatures
## Short Messages
Given a signature scheme for short messages, we need to extend the domain of the signature scheme.
* Let $\text{Sig} = (\text{Gen}, S, V)$ be a signature scheme for short messages $m \in \{0, 1\}^n$
* Let $H: M \to \{0, 1\}^n$ be a collision-resistant hash function where $\text{len}(M) \gg n$

We want to construct $\text{Sig}^{\text{big}} = (\text{Gen}, S^{\text{big}}, V^{\text{big}})$ for messages $m \in M$ of arbitrary length.
* $S^{\text{big}}(sk, M) := S(sk, H(M))$
* $V^{\text{big}}(pk, M, \sigma) := V(pk, H(M), \sigma)$

**Theorem**: If $\text{Sig}$ is secure and $H$ is collision-resistant, then $\text{Sig}^{\text{big}}$ is secure.
**Implication**: It is sufficient to construct a secure signature scheme for short messages.

## One-way Functions
We can use one-way functions to construct signature schemes!

**Type 1**: General one-way functions **can** generate signature schemes!
* Lamport-Merkle signatures and Extended Merkle signature scheme (XMSS)
* **Problem**: signatures with general OWFs are very long.
	* If we want a stateless signer, the signature needs to be around 40 KB.
	* If we want a stateful signer, the signature only needs to be around 4 KB.
* **Advantages**: makes no assumptions, so these signatures are most secure (even against quantum)
	* Often used when size of the signature does not matter (e.g. in software updates)

**Type 2**: Discrete log where $F^{\text{DLog}} = g^x$ in a finite cyclic group $G$
* Elliptic curve signatures (ECDSA) and Schnorr signatures are based on this
* These are **randomized** signature schemes ⟶ different signatures on the same message are different

**Type 3**: Trapdoor permutations (like RSA) where $F: X \to X$ is one-way but has a trapdoor

# Signatures from TDPs
Consider a trapdoor permutation $(\text{Gen}, F, F^{-1})$ such that:
* $F(pk, \cdot): X \to X$ is a one-way function
* $F^{-1}(sk, \cdot): X \to X$ is easy to compute given a trapdoor $sk$
* $F^{-1}(sk, F(pk, x)) = x$ for all $x \in X$
* $F(pk, F^{-1}(sk, x)) = x$ for all $x \in X$ (because it's a permutation)
And consider a deterministic hash function $H: M \to X$

The signature scheme $(\text{Gen}, S, V)$ is defined as follows:
* $\text{Gen}$: the same as $\text{Gen}$ for the TDP
* $S(sk, m \in M) := \sigma \leftarrow F^{-1}(sk, H(m))$
* $V(pk, m, \sigma) := \text{yes} \text{ if } F(pk, \sigma) = H(m) \text{ else } \text{no}$
The intuition is that only the signer can use $F^{-1}$, so no one else can sign messages.

**Theorem**: $(\text{Gen}, S, V)$ is a secure signature scheme if $(Gen, F, F^{-1})$ is a secure TDP (i.e. $F$ is a one-way function) and $H$ is a random oracle.

## RSA-FDH (Full Domain Hash)
To generate a key pair $\text{Gen}$:
1. Choose $n = p \cdot q$ primes and $e$ and $d$ such that $e \cdot d \equiv 1 \bmod \phi(n)$
2. Choose a collision-resistant hash function $H: M \to \mathbb{Z}_n$
3. Output $pk := (n, e, H)$ and $sk := (n, d)$

To sign a message $m \in M$:
* $S(sk, m) := \sigma [\leftarrow H(m)^d \bmod n]$

To verify a signature $\sigma$ on a message $m$:
* $V(pk, m, \sigma) := \text{yes} \text{ iff } [\sigma^e \bmod n = (H(m)^d)^e \bmod n = H(m)]$

Properties:
* Recall that RSA can have a small $e$ but requires a large $d$ for security.
	* This means signing is expensive, but verification is very fast.
* The range of $H$ is $\mathbb{Z}_n$, which means it depends on $n$ and is not constant-sized.

## Why Do We Need to Hash?
Notice that in both of the above schemes, the signature is computed over $H(m)$ instead of $m$ itself.

**Aside on collision resistance:**
* If a hash function is collision resistant, then it is a one-way function.
* To prove this, consider the contrapositive: if $H$ is not one-way, then it is not collision resistant.
	* Since the domain of $H$ is larger than the range, by the pigeonhole principle, multiple inputs must map to the same output.
	* Given $H(x) = y$, when we invert this, we are very likely to find a different input $x'$ where $H(x') = y$.
	* This is a collision on the hash function.
![[Pasted image 20250305152506.png]]

**Suppose we don't hash:** $S(sk, m) := F^{-1}(sk, m) = m^d \bmod n$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}_n$
* This is not secure and susceptible to existential forgery.

**Attack 1:**
* Set $m = 0^n$. We know that the signature must be $0 \bmod n$ due to the nature of the signing algorithm.
* We can give $V(pk, 0^n, 0 \bmod n)$ and it will be valid and return yes.

**Attack 2:**
* Choose an arbitrary signature $\sigma \in X$ and set $m = F(pk, \sigma) = \sigma^e \bmod n$
* Then $(m, \sigma)$ is a valid forgery because $V(pk, m, \sigma) = \text{yes}$
* Hash prevents attackers from choosing the signature first then deriving the message from the signature.
	* An attacker would choose $\sigma$ and derive $H(m) = \sigma^e \bmod n$. They would then need to invert $H$ to get $m$.
	* If we used a hash like SHA-256, which is collision resistant, then this would be hard.

**Attacker 3: Blinding attack on RSA**
Adversary $A$ wants a signature on $m \in \mathbb{Z}_n$:
1. Choose a random $r \in \mathbb{Z}_n$
2. Compute a blinding value $\hat{m} := r^e \cdot m \bmod n$
3. Request a signature on $\hat{m}$ ⟶ gets back $\hat{\sigma} := \hat{m}^d \bmod n$
	* This means $\hat{\sigma}^e = (\hat{m}^d)^e = \hat{m}^{ed} = \hat{m} \bmod n$
4. Set $\sigma := \hat{\sigma} \cdot r^{-1} \bmod n$. This is a valid signature on $m$:
$$
\begin{align*}
\sigma^e & = (\hat{\sigma} \cdot r^{-1})^e \\
& = \hat{\sigma}^e \cdot r^{-e} \\
& = \hat{m} \cdot r^{-e} \tag{because $\hat{\sigma}^e = \hat{m} \bmod n$} \\
& = (r^e \cdot m) \cdot r^{-e} \\
& = m \bmod n
\end{align*}
$$

**Blind Signature**: can ask Alice to sign a **random** $\hat{m}$ and get back a signature on $m$.
* This is an important privacy mechanism: signer can sign to prove identity but the signer does not know what they signed (i.e. message is blinded)
* E.g. in elections, a voter can have the signer sign their voter authentication without revealing their vote.
