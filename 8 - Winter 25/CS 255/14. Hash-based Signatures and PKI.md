# Recap: Digital Signature Schemes
**Digital signatures are a triple of algorithms $(\text{Gen}, S, V)$:**
* $\text{Gen}$ outputs a key pair $(sk, pk)$
* $S(sk, m)$ outputs a signature $\sigma$ on $m$
* $V(pk, m, \sigma)$ outputs $1$ if $\sigma$ is a valid signature on $m$

**There are a few ways to construct digital signature schemes:**
1. Generic one-way function (hash-based signatures, XMSS) ⟶ no assumptions, long signatures
2. Finite cyclic group with discrete log (ECDSA, randomized signature schemes)
3. Trapdoor permutation (RSA) ⟶ slow signing but very fast verification

**RSA-FDH is a scheme based on RSA and a hash function $H$:**
* $pk \leftarrow (n, e, H)$ and $sk \leftarrow (n, d, H)$ where $n = p \cdot q$ and $e \cdot d \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$ and $H: M \to \mathbb{Z}_n$
* To sign, compute inverse of RSA: $S(sk, m) := \big[ \sigma \leftarrow H(m)^d \bmod n \big]$
* To verify, compute hash and check: $V(pk, m, \sigma) := \big[ \text{accept} \iff \sigma^e \bmod n = H(m) \big]$
* **Note**: Public exponent $e$ is small, private exponent $d$ is large ⟶ verification is fast but signing is slow.

**In practice, RSA is used with PKCS1 v1.5 (which is not as secure)**
* **This is not a full domain hash** ⟶ only hashes into a small part of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ because they fix the upper bits.
	* The range/image is a very small part of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ⟶ can't do security analysis on the hash function
* The result of this hash is then used similar to the above, applying the exponent $d$ to get the signature.

# Fast Hash-based Signatures
These are signatures that are derived from generic one-way functions such as hash functions (SHA-256).
* Because they are generic, these signatures are secure against all adversaries (including quantum)

## Lamport: One-Time Signature
Goal: a signature scheme that is **secure as long as $sk$ signs one message** and then throws away the key.

The scheme (Lamport signatures) is as follows:
* Let $V = 256$. Our goal is to sign $V$-bit messages (recall this is enough because we can hash any message $m$ to $V$ bits before signing it)
* Consider a one-way function $H: X \to Y$ such as SHA-256 or AES

* $\text{Gen}()$:
	* output $sk :=$ sample an array of size $2 \times V$ of random elements from $X$
	* output $pk := H(sk)$ an array of size $2 \times V$ containing the hashes of the elements in $sk$
	* Given the public key, we cannot acquire the secret key because $H$ is a one-way function
	* The length of the public key is $2 \times V \times \text{sizeof}(x) = 16 \text{ KB}$

* Signing $S(sk, m \in \{0, 1\}^V)$:
	* The signature is $V$ preimages $\sigma := \big( x[0, m[0]], \ldots, x[V-1, m[V-1]] \big)$
	* Basically at each column, select the preimage of the secret key based on the bitstring $m$
	* The length of the signature is $V \times \text{sizeof}(x) = 256 \times 256 \text{ bits} = 8192 \text{ bytes}$
	* Signing is extremely fast because we do not have any computations, just lookups in the secret key table
![Pasted image 20250307170221](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307170221.png)

* Verifying $V(pk, m, \sigma)$:
	* Accept if $H(\sigma[i]) = pk[i, m[i]]$ for $i = 0, \ldots, V-1$
	* This basically checks if $H(x[i, m[i]]) = y[i, m[i]]$, where $y[i, j]$ was calculated as $H(x[i, j])$

**Theorem**: If $H$ is a one-way function, then the Lamport signature scheme is one-time secure.
* The adversary is given public key $pk$ and **one** chosen message query. Goal is existential forgery.

**Note**:
1. This is a one-time signature scheme ⟶ $\sigma$ exposes the secret key $sk$. The adversary can choose two messages where $m_0 = 0^V$ and $m_1 = 1^V$ to expose the entire $sk$, allowing them to forge signatures for any message.
2. Improvements to this scheme: Merkle-HORS has a 32B public key and a 1KB signature.

## Hash-based: Many-Time Signature
Given a one-time signature scheme, we extend this to sign $n = 2^{40}$ messages. We do so with a **Merkle tree**.

* $\text{Gen}()$:
	1. Make $n$ one-time signature key pairs $(pk_i, sk_i) \leftarrow \text{Gen}_{OTS}()$
	2. Build a Merkle-Tree from the $n$ public keys, putting them as the leaves of the tree
		* To build the tree ⟶ hash pairs of leaves to form a new node, and repeat until we have root
		* To hash ⟶ concatenate the two children and apply the hash function, e.g. $H(pk_i || pk_j)$
		* From HW3: if $H$ is CRH, then $H(pk_i || pk_j)$ is CRH, so the root is CRH ⟶ unique root value for each set of public keys
	3. Set $pk :=$ the root of the Merkle tree
	4. Set $sk :=$ the $n$ secret keys from Step 1.

* $\text{Sign}(sk, m)$:
	1. On message $i$, sign it with $sk_i$ using the one-time signature scheme
	2. Find $pk_i$ in the Merkle tree, the $i$-th leaf of the tree
	3. Generate the Merkle proof $\pi$ that $pk_i$ is a leaf in the tree:
		* To prove $pk_2$: the Merkle proof contains the **siblings** of the nodes on the path from $pk_2$ to the root
		* In this case, the proof contains $pk_1$, $h_1 = H(pk_3 || pk_4)$, $h_2$, and so on
		* The proof contains $O(\log n)$ hashes, allowing the verifier to reconstruct the root from $pk_i$
	4. Output $\sigma := \big( \sigma_i, pk_i, \pi_i \big)$

![Pasted image 20250307164253](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307164253.png)

* $\text{Verify}(pk, m, \sigma = \big( \sigma_i, pk_i, \pi_i \big))$:
	1. Check that $V_{OTS}(pk_i, m_i, \sigma_i)$ accepts
	2. Check that $\pi$ is a valid Merkle proof for $pk_i$ with respect to the root $pk$
	3. Output $1$ if all checks pass, $0$ otherwise

* **Note: Differences from other signature schemes**
	* Signer needs to store state, counter on how many messages they've signed
	* There is now an upper bound on the number of messages that can be signed using the same $sk$
	* **Important**: you must increment the counter before outputting the signature. Otherwise, if the signature is sent but the counter is not incremented, then you use the same leaf $pk_i$ and $sk_i$ twice.
		* Usually, you increment counter first. Check that counter is incremented. Then output the signature.

# Public Key Management
**Key Question**: How does Bob correctly obtain Alice's public key?
* If an attacker fools Bob into using the wrong public key, they can be a man in the middle!

## Single Domain Certificate Authority
A trusted third party (CA) publishes a public verification key $pk_{CA}$ (e.g. preinstalled in OS)
* When Alice generates her key pair $(pk_A, sk_A)$:
	1. She sends $pk_A$ to the CA.
	2. The CA verifies this and gives Alice a **certificate** $cert_A$ that binds $pk_A$ to her identity $A$
* Alice can then send $cert_A$ to Bob:
	1. Bob has $pk_{CA}$ and can verify the CA's signature on $cert_A$
	2. If valid, the $pk_A$ inside $cert_A$ is now trusted by Bob

![Pasted image 20250307170319](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307170319.png)

**Important Notes**
1. Alice only talks to the CA at key generation time (only when she generates a new key pair)
2. The CA does not know Alice's secret key $sk_A$ ⟶ CA cannot read Alice's messages
3. For this to work, everyone in the world must have the CA's public key $pk_{CA}$

**Example Certificates**
* The certificate notes how the CA signed it: in this case it uses RSA-PKCS1 algorithm
* The CA's signature is generated by RSA and is 256 bytes
* Stanford uses an RSA public key with the public exponent $e = 65537$

* Google has a wildcard certificate: used for all Google sites
* Notice that Google is its own CA ⟶ big enough to be trusted

## Negligent and Misbehaving CAs
Malicious CAs can issue certificates for domains that they don't control (e.g. google.com)
![Pasted image 20250307173957](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307173957.png)
Solutions include **pinning** and **certificate transparency**

# Key Transparency
In a messaging scheme with a central server (e.g. iMessage):
* The server has a (user, pk) database for all of its users
* The server sends public keys to other users when asked
* If Alice wants Bob's public key from iMessage, how does she know that it's authentic?
![Pasted image 20250307171752](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307171752.png)

**Solution**: Force the server to send the same public key to all users.
* This allows Bob to then ask for his own public key from the server, and verify whether it's authentic or not.

## Step 1: How to Commit to a Key-value DB?
Given a key, we use a **trie** to very quickly find the value associated with that key.
* To improve security, we use a **Merkle Trie**: place a hash at each internal node.
	* We hash V2 and V3. Then hash that with V1. THen hash that with V4 to get the root hash.
	* The **root hash** (32 bytes) is a commitment to the database ⟶ proves its validity
* Because of the CRH ⟶ cannot find `DB` and `DB'` with the same root hash/commitment
![Pasted image 20250307172047](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307172047.png)

* Suppose Alice knows the root hash.
	* The server can easily prove that `B[010] = V2` by revealing certain values to allow Alice
	* Alice recomputes the root and compares it to her copy of the root
	* Generally, the proof size is around $\log_2 |DB|$
![Pasted image 20250307172508](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307172508.png)

* The server can also prove that `B[101]` is not in the DB:
	* The server reveals the nodes along the path until it reaches a "dead end"
	* For example, if trying to find `B[101]` but the trie only has nodes up to `B[10]`
	* The server provides the hashes needed to compute the root hash up to `B[10]`
	* Alice verifies these hashes match her root hash and sees there's no continuation to `B[101]`

## Step 2: Key Transparency
* The server has a huge `(user_id, pk)` database ⟶ e.g. with around 3 billion entries
* The server publishes a commitment/root hash to the DB that all clients can download
* When someone asks for $pk_B$:
	1. Server sends $pk_B$ and a proof that the database `DB[Bob] = pk_B`
	2. Alice verifies the proof and accepts if valid
	3. This forces the server to send the same $pk_B$ to all users (otherwise they can't make a proof)

## Step 3: Updating Keys
If Bob updates his public key, how do we update the server's DB?
* The DB contains a list $((\text{user}, i), pk)$ ⟶ version $i$ of the user's $pk$
* Every day: server publishes an updated root hash with the new updated keys (~10M updates per day)
* When Alice asks for Bob's key:
	1. Server sends the list $\{(Bob, i), pk_i, \pi_i \mid i \in [1, 2, \ldots, n]\}$
	2. Server sends proof that slot $(Bob, n + 1)$ is empty
	3. Alice can use these to verify that the server is sending the correct $pk_B$
* A third party **auditor** confirms every day that the DB on day $t$ is a subset of the DB on day $t-1$
	* Subset because the server can't remove any keys, only new ones
