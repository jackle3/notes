# Recap: Encryption
* PRFs: $F: K \times X \to Y$ that is indistinguishable from a random $\text{func}: X \to Y$
* PRPs: $P: K \times X \to X$ that is indistinguishable from a random $\text{perm}: X \to X$ and is efficiently invertible

* A PRP over $(K, X)$ is also a PRF over $(K, X, X)$

## One-Time Key Encryption
* `ctr-mode`: Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher by encrypting sequential counter values
* The security under one-time key is **semantic security**

## Many-Time Key Encryption
* `randomized-ctr-mode`: Uses a random IV as the initial counter value to generate a stream cipher
* `cbc-mode`: Chains block cipher operations by XORing each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block, starting with a random IV
* The security under many-time key is **chosen plaintext attack (CPA) security**

## Integrity
* Recall that these do not provide any form of integrity.
* E.g. consider an encryption scheme $c := E(k, m) = m \oplus G(k)$.
	* The encryption of $m \oplus \Delta$ is $(m \oplus \Delta) \oplus G(k) = m \oplus G(k) \oplus \Delta = c \oplus \Delta$

# Message Integrity
* Given two parties $A$ (sender) and $B$ (receiver), $A$ sends messages over a public channel to $B$ such that:
	* $B$ can verify that messages truly came from $A$ (authenticity)
	* $B$ can detect if messages were modified in transit (integrity)
	* Note: The messages themselves do not need to be secret/encrypted
* Solution: **tags**
	* $A$ computes a tag $t := S(k, m)$ and sends $(m, t)$ over the channel
	* $B$ verifies the tag $t$ using $V(k, m, t)$ which returns yes or no

* Note: checksums, which do not require keys, protect random errors but **not malicious** errors.
	* Adversary can simply recompute checksum for modified message $m'$

## Message Authentication Code
* A MAC defined over $(K, M, T)$ is a pair of efficient algorithms $(S, V)$ such that:
	* $S(k, m) \to t \in T$
	* $V(k, m, t) \to \{\text{yes}, \text{no}\}$
	* For all $k \in K$, $m \in M \quad \to \quad V(k, m, S(k, m)) = \text{yes}$
		* Note: this can technically be satisfied by a $V$ that always returns $\text{yes}$, though not secure

## Secure MACs
* Attacker's power: **chosen message attack**
	* Attacker can choose $m_1, \ldots, m_q \in M$ and get back $t_1, \ldots, t_q \in T$ where $t_i = S(k, m_i)$
* Attacker's goal: **existential forgery**
	* Produce valid $(m, t)$ such that $(m, t) \notin \{(m_i, t_i)\}_{i=1}^q$
	* I.e. adversary cannot produce a valid tag for any message, including the ones it has queried

### Mac Game
* For a MAC $(S, V)$ and adversary $A$, define the MAC game as:
	* The challenger picks a random $k \in K$
	* Repeat $q$ times:
		* $A$ sends $m_i$ to the challenger.
		* The challenger replies with $t_i := S(k, m_i)$
	* $A$ outputs a pair $(m, t)$
	* $A$ wins if $V(k, m, t) = \text{yes}$ and $(m, t) \notin \{(m_i, t_i)\}_{i=1}^q$

* **Definition:** A MAC $I = (S, V)$ is a secure MAC if for all efficient adversaries $A$, the probability that $A$ wins the MAC game is negligible.
$$
\text{MAC}_\text{adv}[A, I] := \Pr[\text{challenger outputs win}] \tag{secure if negligible}
$$

## Constructing a MAC
* Every secure PRF with a sufficiently large range (e.g. $|Y| \geq 2^{128}$) gives a secure MAC
	* Let $F$ be a secure PRF over $(K, X, Y)$
	* Define $I_F := (S, V)$ as:
		* $S(k, m) := F(k, m)$
		* $V(k, m, t) := \mathbf{1}\left[F(k, m) = t\right]$
	* Then $I_F$ is a secure MAC

* **Theorem**: If $F$ is a secure PRF over $(K, X, Y)$ and $\frac{1}{|Y|}$ is negligible, then $I_F$ is a secure MAC.
* $|Y|$ needs to be large because:
	* Suppose $|Y| = 2^{10} = 1024$. The adversary can guess the tag and get it right with probability $1/1024$
	* The advantage of the forgery attack is thus $1/1024$ which is not negligible
* **Proof of Theorem:**
	1. Replace $F(k, \cdot)$ with a random function $f \in \text{Func}(X, Y)$
		* $F$ is a secure PRF implies adversary $A$ cannot distinguish between $F$ and $f$
	2. $A$ queries $f$ at $m_1, \ldots, m_q \in M$ and must guess $F(m)$ at $m \notin \{m_1, \ldots, m_q\}$
		* Notice that $F(m)$ is independent of $f(m_1), \ldots, f(m_q)$ that the adversary has queried
		* The probability of $A$ guessing $F(m)$ correctly is thus $1/|Y|$ which is negligible
	3. When the function is truly random, the advantage is $1/|Y|$.
		* Since the random function is indistinguishable from $F$, the advantage is negligible
	4. Formally, for every adversary $A$, there exists a PRF adversary $B$ such that:
		* $\text{MAC}_\text{adv}[A, I_F] \leq \underbrace{\text{PRF}_\text{adv}[B, F]}_{\text{step 1}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{|Y|}}_{\text{step 2}}$
### AES
* Thus, AES gives a secure MAC for 16-byte messages (because block size is 16 bytes)

# Building a Large MAC
* **Goal**: Given a small PRF, build a big PRF, which gives us a secure MAC for big messages
	* There's a few constructions that do this:
		1. CBC-MAC: used by banking
		2. HMAC: used in the internet protocol
		3. Carter-Wegman MACs: very fast MAC, but requires polynomials over finite fields to calculate
		4. PMAC: parallel MAC (not very used because it's patented)
* **Lengths of MAC**:
	* MAC built from AES often has a 128-bit tag length
	* Can't have a tag that is too short though:
		* E.g. Gallileo GPS uses a 32-bit MAC, which an adversary can forge with probability $1/2^{32}$ which is not negligible

## Encrypted CBC-MAC
* Let $F$ be a PRF over $(K, X, X)$ where $X = \{0, 1\}^{n}$.
* Define a new PRF $F_{\text{CBC}}$ that takes message blocks and sequentially applies $F$ to each block.
![Pasted image 20250129215915](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250129215915.png)
* $F_{\text{CBC}}$ is a secure PRF defined over $(K^2, X^{\leq l}, X)$
	* I.e. using two keys $k_1$ and $k_2$, and given at most $l$ blocks, it produces a single output block that is the tag

* We need $F(k_2, \cdot)$ because otherwise $F_{\text{CBC}}$ is insecure. Consider just $\text{Raw}_\text{CBC}$:
	1. Adversary chooses arbitrary single block $m \in X$
	2. Requests tag on $m$ which is $t := \text{Raw}_\text{CBC}(k_1, m) = F(k_1, m)$
	3. Output $(\text{msg}, \text{tag})$ where:
		* $\text{msg} := (m, t \oplus m) \in X^{2}$ is two blocks
		* $\text{tag} := t$
	4. Observe that:
$$
\begin{align*}
	\text{Raw}_\text{CBC}(k_1, (m, t \oplus m)) = F(k_1, \underbrace{F(k_1, m)}_{t} \oplus (t \oplus m)) = \underbrace{F(k_1, m)}_{t} = t
\end{align*}
$$
	* which means that $t$ is a valid tag for the message $(m, t \oplus m)$

* **CBC-MAC Theorem**: For any $L > 0$, if $F$ is a secure PRF then $F_{\text{CBC}}$ is a secure PRF.
	* In particular, for every $q$-query adversary $A$ attacking $F_{\text{CBC}}$, there exists a PRF adversary $B$ attacking $F$ such that:
		* $\text{PRF}_\text{adv}[A, F_{\text{CBC}}] \leq \text{PRF}_\text{adv}[B, F] + \frac{q^2 \times L^{o(1)}}{|X|}$
		* where $\text{PRF}_\text{adv}[B, F]$ is negligible because $F$ is a secure PRF
	* This implies CBC-MAC is secure as long as $q \ll \sqrt{|X|}$
		* This is why we had to move to a 128-bit domain ($|X| = 2^{128}$)
		* $q$ is basically the number of messages that you compute the tag for

## PMAC
* Problem: CBC-MAC is sequential. We want to be able to use parallel hardware.
* `pad` is necessary to prevent repeated messages and permutation attacks:
	* We send four blocks of `m0`, after the xor it will be `0`, so the tag will be `F(k', 0)`
		* This tag is the same as sending four blocks of `m1`
	* We send `m0, m1, m2, m3` and the tag if `F(k', m0 \oplus m1 \oplus m2 \oplus m3)`
		* This tag is the same as the permutation `m3, m2, m1, m0`

## HMAC
* Most widely used MAC, used in the internet protocol

### Collision Resistant Hash Functions
* A hash function $H: M \to T$ is a function such that $|T| \ll |M|$
* A collision for $H$ is a pair of messages $m_0, m_1 \in M$ such that $m_0 \neq m_1$ and $H(m_0) = H(m_1)$

* **Definition**: A hash function $H: M \to T$ is collision resistant if for all *explicit* efficient algorithms $A$:
$$
\text{CR}_\text{adv}[A, H] := \Pr[\text{A outputs a collision for } H] \text{ is negligible}
$$
* This is weird:
	* By pigeonhole principle, there are more messages than hashes, so there must be collisions
	* But this says that no efficient algorithm can find a collision
* Examples:
	* SHA-(256, 384, 512) is collision resistant (designed in 2001, not optimized for modern processors)
	* SHA3-(256, 384, 512) is collision resistant (designed in 2014, better suited for 64-bit processors)

### Applying CRHFs to MACs
* Suppose $(S, V)$ is a secure MAC over $(K, M, T)$ where $|M|$ is small (short messages)
* Suppose $H: M^{\text{big}} \to M$ is a collision resistant hash function
* Define a new MAC $(S', V')$ over $(K, M^{\text{big}}, T)$ as:
	* $S'(k, m) := S(k, H(m))$
	* $V'(k, m, t) := V(k, H(m), t)$
	* where $m \in M^{\text{big}}$ and $H(m) \in M$
* We need $H$ to be collision resistant because otherwise if $H(m_0) = H(m_1)$ then $S(k, H(m_0)) = S(k, H(m_1))$
	* The adversary can compute the tag for $m_0$ and use it for $m_1$

* **Theorem**: If $(S, V)$ is a secure MAC and $H$ is a CRHF, then $(S', V')$ is a secure MAC.
* **Proof**: Let's prove this by contradiction:
	* Assume $(S', V')$ is NOT secure. This means there exists an efficient adversary $A$ that can forge tags.
	* We'll show this leads to a contradiction by breaking either:
		1. The security of the original MAC $(S,V)$, or
		2. The collision resistance of $H$
	* Here's how:
		* Let $m^*$ be the message that $A$ forges a tag $t^*$ for
		* This means $V'(k, m^*, t^*) = 1$ but $m^*$ was never queried before
		* By definition of $V'$, this means $V(k, H(m^*), t^*) = 1$
	* Now, there are two possibilities:
		1. $H(m^*)$ was never queried to the original MAC $(S,V)$
			* In this case, we found a forgery for $(S,V)$, contradicting its security
		2. $H(m^*)$ was queried before, but with a different message $m'$
			* This means $H(m^*) = H(m')$ but $m^* \neq m'$
			* We found a collision in $H$, contradicting collision resistance
	* Both cases lead to a contradiction
	* Therefore, our assumption must be wrong
	* Thus, $(S', V')$ must be secure
