# Recap
## CRHF
* A collision-resistant hash is $H: M \to T$ such that it's hard to find $m_0 \neq m_1$ s.t. $H(m_0) = H(m_1)$
* Constructions:
	* SHA2 uses the Davies-Meyer compression function, which is plugged into Merkle-Damgard to build a CRHF for large messages
## Birthday Attack
* Given a CRHF $H$, an attacker can find a collision in time $O(2^{\ell/2})$ where $\ell$ is the output length in bits
* To be secure, the output of the hash function should be at least 256 bits, meaning a collision can be found in time $O(2^{128})$
## CRHF: Merkle-Damgard
* Given a compression function for small fixed-size blocks (e.g. Davies-Meyer), Merkle-Damgard constructs a CRHF for arbitrary large messages
	* Split message into fixed-size blocks
	* Iteratively apply compression function to each block with previous output
	* Final output is a fixed-size hash regardless of input length

# Keyed Hash Functions
* **Goal:** How to build a PRF from a CRHF $H: M \to T$?
	* Note: this PRF is a MAC because every secure PRF with a large range gives a secure MAC
* How do we create a keyed hash function (PRF) from a CRHF that doesn't have a key?

## Bad Attempt
* Prepend the key to the message and use that as the input to the CRHF
$$
F(k, m) := H(k || m)
$$
* This is insecure because of an *extension attack* on Merkle-Damgard hash functions
	* Given $y=F(k, m)$, an attacker can efficiently compute $y' = F(k, m||x)$ for any $x$.
	* Recall that Merkle-Damgard was just a chain, passing the output of the previous block's compression function as the input to the next block's compression function
	* The attacker can just take $y$, treat it as a chaining variable $c$, compress that with $x$ using the compression function, and then continue the chain
	* This is an existential forgery because the attacker can create a valid MAC for a new message $(m||x)$ that they have never seen before, without knowing the key $k$

## HMAC
* First, take the key $k$ and xor it with an inner pad $\texttt{ipad}$, then concatenate it with $m$. Then compute the hash of this.
* Then take the key $k$ and xor it with an outer pad $\texttt{opad}$, then concatenate it with the hash from the previous step. Then compute the hash of this.
$$
F_{\text{HMAC}}(k, m) := H\Big(k \oplus \texttt{opad} || \underbrace{H(k \oplus \texttt{ipad} || m)}_{32\text{ bytes}}\Big)
$$
* Notes:
	* $\texttt{ipad}$ and $\texttt{opad}$ are fixed values defined in the standard
	* The inner pad does the bulk of the work. The outer pad is very fast, just to prevent extension attacks.
	* Notice that HMAC is pretty much a wrapper around a CRHF (e.g. SHA256). This means if a library provides a CRHF, we can easily construct a MAC and a PRF from it (i.e. HMAC)

* **Theorem**: If the compression function used in the Merkle-Damgard construction (e.g. Davies-Meyer) is a secure PRF, then the HMAC is a secure PRF.

# CRHF for Integrity of Software Packages
* When you try to install a Python library from a repo, what happens?
	* Package itself comes from the **repo server**
	* There exists a separate **integrity server** that stores the collision-resistant hashes (e.g. SHA256 checksum) of all the packages in the repo
		* Important: attacker can write to repo server but not to the integrity server
	* When you download the package, you compute the hash of the package and compare it to the hash stored on the server

# Authenticated Encryption
* So far, we've seen:
	* Confidentiality: encryption that secures messages from eavesdroppers
	* Integrity: MACs that secure messages from data tampering
* We want to now provide both confidentiality and integrity!

## Confidentiality without Integrity
* **Main Point**: CPA security without integrity provides no confidentiality
* **Example**:
	* Alice wants to send a message $m$ to Bob. She encrypts it using randomized counter mode (CPA secure) to the mail server.
	* The mail server will decrypt the message and forward it to Bob.

### Tampering
* Mel can intercept the ciphertext $c$ and modify it in either mode:

* **For CTR mode**:
* If $c \leftarrow E_\text{CTR}(k, m)$, then for any $\Delta$, we have $D_\text{CTR}(k, c \oplus \Delta) = m \oplus \Delta$
	* This is because in CTR mode, encryption is just XORing the message with a keystream: $c = m \oplus F(k,\text{ctr})$
	* When we XOR the ciphertext with $\Delta$, we get: $c \oplus \Delta = (m \oplus F(k,\text{ctr})) \oplus \Delta$
	* During decryption, we XOR with the same keystream: $D(k, c \oplus \Delta) = (m \oplus F(k,\text{ctr})) \oplus \Delta \oplus F(k,\text{ctr})$
	* By associativity of XOR, this equals: $m \oplus \Delta \oplus F(k,\text{ctr}) \oplus F(k,\text{ctr}) = m \oplus \Delta$
	* So the $\Delta$ "passes through" the encryption/decryption process directly

* **For CBC mode**:
* If $c \leftarrow E_\text{CBC}(k, m)$, then modifying a ciphertext block $c_i$ affects two plaintext blocks:
	* The corresponding plaintext block $m_i$ will be completely scrambled
	* The next plaintext block $m_{i+1}$ will have the same modification as was made to $c_i$
	* This is because in CBC mode, $m_{i+1} = D(k, c_{i+1}) \oplus c_i$
	* So if we modify $c_i$ to $c_i \oplus \Delta$, then $m_{i+1}$ becomes:
		* $m_{i+1}' = D(k, c_{i+1}) \oplus (c_i \oplus \Delta) = m_{i+1} \oplus \Delta$

* In either mode, an attacker can modify blocks of the ciphertext to change the message:
	* By carefully choosing $\Delta$, they can change specific bytes like changing `b` to `m`, `o` to `e`, and `b` to `l`
	* This changes the message from `To: bob` to `To: mel`
![[Pasted image 20250206152713.png]]
* The attacker can then send this modified ciphertext to the mail server and cause it to route differently.

## Definition of AE
* The goal is to provide CPA security with ciphertext integrity.
* If $(E, D)$ is to provide authenticated encryption, then algorithm $D(k, c)$ should output message $m$ or a special symbol $\text{reject}$ that indicates the ciphertext is invalid.

### Ciphertext Integrity Game
1. The challenger generates a random secret key $k$.
2. The adversary can submit the message $m_i$ and get back $c_i \leftarrow E(k, m_i)$.
3. The adversary should output some new ciphertext $c$.
	* The adversary wins the game if $D(k, c) \neq \text{reject}$ and the ciphertext is new (i.e. not one of the $c_i$).
![[Pasted image 20250206153320.png]]

A cipher $(E, D)$ has ciphertext integrity if for all efficient adversaries $A$:
$$
\text{Adv}_\text{int}(A, (E, D)) = \Pr[A \text{ wins}]
$$
is negligible.

### Example: Rand-ctr-mode
* Randomized counter mode is CPA secure but does not have ciphertext integrity
	* Adversary requests $c \leftarrow E(k, m)$ for some message $m$
	* Adversary can return $c \oplus 1^n$ to flip all the bits of the ciphertext
	* This is valid because randomized counter mode will never reject, and this is necessarily a new ciphertext

### Definition of AE
* A cipher $(E, D)$ provides authenticated encryption if it has both CPA security and ciphertext integrity.

## Constructing Authenticated Encryption
* We can construct A.E. schemes using a secure MAC $I = (S, V)$ and a CPA secure cipher $(E, D)$.
* The scheme is as follows:
	* Generate two independent keys $k = (k_e, k_m)$ for the cipher and the MAC

### Option 1: MAC-then-Encrypt (SSL)
* To encrypt:
	1. Compute the MAC of the message: $t \leftarrow S(k_m, m)$
	2. Then encrypt the concatenation of the message and the tag: $c \leftarrow E(k_e, m || t)$
* To decrypt:
	1. First decrypt the ciphertext: $m || t \leftarrow D(k_e, c)$
	2. Then verify the MAC: $V(k_m, m, t)$
	3. If the MAC is valid, output $m$. Otherwise, output $\text{reject}$
![[attachments/Untitled 16 40.png|Untitled 16 40.png]]
* This is **insecure** because of the POODLE attack. This method has no ciphertext integrity.
![[Pasted image 20250206160422.png]]

### Option 2: Encrypt-then-MAC (TLS and GCM)
* To encrypt:
	1. Compute the encryption of the message: $c \leftarrow E(k_e, m)$
	2. Then compute the MAC of the ciphertext: $t \leftarrow S(k_m, c)$
	3. Output the ciphertext and the tag: $(c, t)$
* To decrypt:
	1. First verify the MAC: $V(k_m, c, t)$
	2. If the MAC is valid, decrypt the ciphertext and output the result: $m \leftarrow D(k_e, c)$
	3. Otherwise, output $\text{reject}$
![[attachments/Untitled 17 37.png|Untitled 17 37.png]]
* **Theorem**: The encrypt-then-MAC provides authenticated encryption whenever $(E, D)$ is CPA secure and $(S, V)$ is a secure MAC.

### Option 3: Encrypt-and-MAC (SSH)
* To encrypt:
	1. Compute the MAC of the message: $t \leftarrow S(k_m, m)$
	2. Then encrypt the message: $c \leftarrow E(k_e, m)$
	3. Then send the ciphertext and the **message's** tag: $(c, t)$
* To decrypt:
	1. First decrypt the ciphertext: $m \leftarrow D(k_e, c)$
	2. Then verify the MAC: $V(k_m, m, t)$
	3. If the MAC is valid, output $m$. Otherwise, output $\text{reject}$
![[attachments/Untitled 18 35.png|Untitled 18 35.png]]
* This is **insecure** if the MAC can leak information about the message, because the MAC is computed on the message and sent in the clear
	* **Note**: SSH is secure though because it uses a PRF for the MAC, so the MAC does not leak information about the message. It also uses a counter so that the MAC of two messages that are the same will be different.

## Galois Counter Mode
* This is [[5. CPA Security#Nonce-based Encryption|nonce-based counter mode]] encryption (which is CPA secure), then we compute a Carter-Wegman MAC on the ciphertext.

## AEAD
* Network packets typically have a (1) header and (2) payload.
	* We **cannot encrypt this header** because it tells the router how to route the packet.
	* We’d like to **provide integrity for the header**, but only encrypt the payload.
* **Implementation:** The MAC is computed over the encrypted data + associated data.
	* Provides integrity for both encrypted data and associated data.
	* $c \leftarrow E(k_e, m)$
	* $t \leftarrow S(k_m, \text{aad} || c)$
	* output $(c, t)$
![[attachments/Untitled 19 32.png|Untitled 19 32.png]]
* The output of `encrypt(…)` is the a `(ciphertext, tag)` pair
![[attachments/Untitled 20 32.png|Untitled 20 32.png]]
* Make sure the IV/nonce is different for each message.

# Case Study: AES-GCM in TLS 1.3
* Recall that GCM is an AEAD scheme that uses the encrypt-then-MAC construction.
![[Pasted image 20250206163047.png]]
* TLS uses unidirectional keys: $(k_{b \to s}, k_{s \to b})$
* It uses **stateful encryption**: each side maintains a 64-bit write sequence counter ($\text{wsc}_b$ and $\text{wsc}_s$)
	* Whenever a browser sends a record, it increments its $\text{wsc}_b$
		* When the server receives a record, it also increments its $\text{wsc}_b$
	* Whenever a server sends a record, it increments its $\text{wsc}_s$
		* When the browser receives a record, it also increments its $\text{wsc}_s$

* When browser sends record to the server:
	* $\text{key} = k_{b \to s}$ = (\text{encryption key}, $\text{MAC key}$)
	* $\text{aad} = (\text{wsc}_b, \text{record type}, \text{protocol version = 3.1})$
	* $\text{nonce} = \text{wsc}_b \oplus \underbrace{\text{client write iv}}_{\text{random value generated at session setup}}$
		* This ensures every record that is sent has a unique nonce
	* We include the $\text{wsc}_b$ in the MAC to prevent **replay attacks**, **dropped records**, and **record insertion attacks**
		* **Replay attacks**: an attacker could replay a record to the server (e.g. purchase request to Amazon)
			* When server receives record, it will validate with its own $\text{wsc}_b$. If it doesn't match (e.g. bc of replay), it will reject the record
		* **Dropped records**: an attacker could drop a record and break integrity
		* **Record insertion attacks**: an attacker could insert a record and break integrity
