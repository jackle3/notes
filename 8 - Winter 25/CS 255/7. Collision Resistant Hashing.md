# Recap
* Secure MAC algorithm $(S, V)$ is one that is:
	* Existentially unforgeable under a chosen message attack. This means adversary can query the tag on arbitrary messages, and is then unable to forge a valid tag for a new message.
* A PRF with a large enough range derives a secure MAC (e.g. AES).
	* Issue: the domain of PRFs are small, so we can only MAC short messages.
* CBC-MAC: Using the PRF of a small domain, produce a PRF for a large domain
	* Issue: this is sequential so it's slow.

# Collision Resistant Hashing
* Let $H: M \to T$ be a hash function where $|T| \ll |M|$
* A collision for $H$ is a pair of messages $m_0, m_1 \in M$ such that $m_0 \neq m_1$ and $H(m_0) = H(m_1)$.
	* By the pigeonhole principle, there are more messages than hash values, so many collisions exist.
* $H$ is **collision resistant** if for all efficient adversaries $A$:
$$
\text{CR}_\text{adv}[A, H] := \Pr[\text{A outputs a collision for } H] \text{ is negligible}
$$
* This means that no efficient adversary can find a collision for $H$

## HMAC
* HMAC uses collision resistant hash functions to handle large messages
	* First hash the large message to get a small one using a collision resistant hash function H
	* Then apply a secure MAC (like a PRF) to the hashed message
* Given a MAC $(S, V)$ that works on short messages. We can produce $(S', V')$ that works on large messages:
$$
S'(k, M) := S(k, H(M)) \tag{where $|M| \gg |H(M)|$}
$$
$$
V'(k, M, t) := V(k, H(M), t)
$$
* This is secure if $H$ is collision resistant. If it were not, an adversary could find a collision $m_0, m_1$ s.t. $H(m_0) = H(m_1)$ and then $S'(k, m_0) = S'(k, m_1)$.

# Birthday Paradox
* Let $r_1, \ldots, r_n \in \{1, \ldots, B\}$ be independent and uniform random variables.
* **Theorem**: When $n \geq 1.2 \sqrt{B}$, then:
$$
\Pr[\exists i \neq j: \quad r_i = r_j] \geq \frac{1}{2}
$$
* **Example**: Consider birthdays where $B=365$. If there are $n \geq 1.2 \sqrt{365} \approx 23$ people, then the probability that there exists a pair of people with the same birthday is at least $1/2$.
* **Note**: The uniform distribution is the worst case for this theorem.
	* Given independent random variables that were not uniform, the probability of collision would be more.
	* Number of samples to get collision of at least $1/2$ will be less than $1.2 \sqrt{B}$

* **Proof**:
$$
\begin{align*}
\Pr[\exists i \neq j: \quad r_i = r_j] &= 1 - \Pr[\forall i \neq j: \quad r_i \neq r_j] \quad \text{(complement of no collision)}\\
&= 1 - \Pr[r_1 \neq r_2, \ldots, r_1 \neq r_n, r_2 \neq r_3, \ldots, r_{n-1} \neq r_n] \\
&= 1 - \Pr[r_1 \neq r_2] \cdot \Pr[r_3 \neq r_1, r_3 \neq r_2] \cdots \Pr[r_n \neq r_1, \ldots, r_n \neq r_{n-1}] \\
&= 1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{B}\right) \left(1 - \frac{2}{B}\right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{n-1}{B}\right) \\
&= 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{n-1} \left(1 - \frac{i}{B}\right) \\
&\geq 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{n-1} e^{-i/B} \quad \text{(since $1 - x \leq e^{-x}$ for all $x \geq 0$)}\\
&= 1 - e^{-\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i/B} \\
&= 1 - e^{-n(n-1)/(2B)} \\
&\geq 1 - e^{-n^2/(2B)} \quad \text{(since $-n(n-1) \geq -n^2$)} \\
&\geq 1 - e^{-1.2^2/2} \quad \text{(since $n \geq 1.2\sqrt{B}$)} \\
&= 1 - e^{-0.72} \\
&\approx 0.513
\end{align*}
$$

## Implications on CRH
* If $H: M \to T$ outputs $\ell$-bit strings ($T = \{0, 1\}^{\ell}$), then:
	* We can find a collision for $H$ with probability $1/2$ in time $O(2^{\ell/2})$ by the birthday paradox
	* This is because $|T| = 2^\ell$, so we need $1.2\sqrt{2^\ell} = 1.2 \times 2^{\ell/2}$ random samples

### Birthday Attack
1. Choose random $m_0, m_1, \ldots, m_{2^{\ell/2}}$ uniformly at random from $M$
	* With extremely high probability, there will be no collisions in messages since $|M| \gg |T| = 2^\ell$
2. Compute $S := \{H(m_0), H(m_1), \ldots, H(m_{2^{\ell/2}})\}$
	* Note: these are independent but not uniform — hash function is not necessarily uniform
3. Look for a collision in $S$.
	* Sort the set in time $O(n \log n)$ then compare adjacent elements
	* This means we need time $O(n \log n)$ but also $O(n)$ space (infeasible when $\ell$ is large)
	* To do so in constant memory:
		* Start with a random $x_0$ and compute the sequence $x_i = H(x_{i-1})$
		* After enough iterations, sequence will loop (since $T$ is finite)
			* This loop is of length $O(\sqrt{|T|})$
		* When $x_i = x_j$ for some $i < j$, we found a collision
		* This forms a "rho" shape ($\rho$), hence called the rho algorithm
		* Only need to store current value in the sequence

* This takes time $2^{\ell/2}$ since that's how many hashes we compute.
* The probability of finding a collision is at least $1/2$.

### Minimum Hash Size
* If we had a 128-bit hash, we could find a collision in time $2^{64}$. A computer can do this in a few minutes.
* This is why we use 256-bits (e.g. SHA-256) since it is $2^{128}$ time for the birthday attack.

## Quantum
* There is some evidence that there is a universal quantum attack that finds collisions in time $2^{\ell/3}$
* This is still an open problem.

# Constructing CRHFs
* There are two main approaches:
	* Merkle-Damgard — used by SHA2
	* Hash-based authentication codes — used by SHA3

## Merkle-Damgard
### Construction
1. Given a large message, break it up into blocks.
2. Pad our last block using a pad so that all blocks are $b$ bits long.
3. Start from a fixed `IV`, pass `IV` and `m[0]` through a compression function $h$ to get $c_1$.
4. Then pass $c_1$ and `m[1]` through $h$ to get $c_2$.
5. Continue until we have processed the entire message.

### Terminology
![Pasted image 20250131164529](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250131164529.png)

### Pad
* Ensures that the message length is a multiple of $b$ bits.
* Constructed by starting with a `1` bit then padding with `0` bits. Then we put the `msg_len` in the last $64$ bits.
	* If not enough space for `msg_len`, then we add a dummy block where the entire block is the pad.

### Theorem
* If $h$ is a collision resistant hash (compression function), then $H_{\text{MD}}$ is a collision resistant hash.
* **Proof** (contrapositive):
	* Suppose that $H_{\text{MD}}$ is not collision resistant. That means we have $M \neq M'$ s.t. $H_{\text{MD}}(M) = H_{\text{MD}}(M')$.
	* Goal: we will use this to find a collision on $h$.
	![Pasted image 20250131165117](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250131165117.png)
	* We know there was a collision, so:
		* $H_{\text{MD}}(m) = H_{\text{MD}}(m')$ $\quad \implies \quad$ $c_t = c_r'$ where $c_t$ is last chain var of $M$ and $c_r$ is last chain var of $M'$.
		* This means $h(M[t-1], c_{t-1}) = c_t = c_r' = h(M'[r-1], c_{r-1})$
	* If $(M[t-1], c_{t-1}) \neq (M'[r-1], c'_{r-1})$, then we have a collision on $h$.
	* If not, meaning $M[t-1] = M'[r-1]$ and $c_{t-1} = c'_{r-1}$.
		* This means $t = r$ (meaning last blocks of $M$ and $M'$ are the same) and $c_t = c_r$ (meaning last chain variables are the same).
		* We can apply the argument again in this case to $c_{t-1}$ and $c'_{t-1}$ to get:
			1. Either collision on $h$ or,
			2. $M[t-2] = M'[t-2]$ and $c_{t-2} = c'_{t-2}$, in which case we continue again.
	* We continue this process all the way until the first block.
		1. Either we have a collision on $h$ as desired, or
		2. We have $M[0] = M'[0]$ and $c_0 = c'_0$.
			* This means $M$ and $M'$ are identical.
			* This contradicts our assumption that $M \neq M'$.

### Davies-Meyer: Constructing a Collision Resistant Compression Function
* Consider a compression function $h: \{0, 1\}^b \times T \to T$.
* Let $E(k, x)$ be a block cipher over $(K, X)$ where $X = \{0, 1\}^n$.
* **Davies-Meyer construction**: $h(\underbrace{m}_{\text{msg}}, \underbrace{c}_{\text{chain var}}) := E(\underbrace{m}_{\text{key}}, \underbrace{c}_{\text{msg}}) \oplus c$
![Pasted image 20250131170059](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250131170059.png)
* **Theorem**: If $E$ is an "ideal cipher", then finding a collision on $h$ takes time at least $2^{n/2}$.
	* This says that the birthday attack is optimal for finding collisions in $h$, since we know birthday attacks can find collisions in time $O(2^{n/2})$ and this theorem proves we cannot do better.

* SHA-256 uses this construction with SHACAL2 as the block cipher.

## Summary
1. A fixed block cipher (SHACAL2) goes into Davies-Meyer to give us a compression function.
2. This compression function goes into Merkle-Damgard to give us collision resistant hash function for arbitrary large domains.
