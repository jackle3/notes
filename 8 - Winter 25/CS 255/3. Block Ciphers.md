# Recap
## OTP
* OTP has **perfect secrecy** ⟶ secure against an adversary that gets to see *exactly one* ciphertext
	* Problem: has long keys — keys must be as big as the message
## PRG
* Solution: use a PRG which is an efficient function $G: \{0, 1\}^s \to \{0, 1\}^n$ where $n >> s$.
* A PRG is secure if for every efficient adversary algorithm $A$ behaves almost the same on:
	* the pseudorandom distribution $\{k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} \{0,1\}^s \text{ and } r \leftarrow G(k); \text{output } r\}$
	* the truly random distribution $\{r \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} \{0,1\}^n; \text{output } r\}$
* In math, a PRG is secure if:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Adv}[A, G] &= \left| Pr \left[\substack{k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} \{0,1\}^s \\ r \leftarrow G(k)} : A(r) = 1\right] - Pr[r \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} \{0,1\}^n : A(r) = 1] \right| \\
&\leq \epsilon
\end{align*}
$$
	where $\epsilon$ is negligible and $A(r) = 1$ means that $A$ believes $r$ is random

* Visually, a PRG is secure if given a sample from $2^s$ dots in $\{0,1\}^n$, the polynomial-time adversary cannot tell the difference between the pseudorandom dots and the truly random dots.

## How to Generate the Seed?
* Need to generate cryptographically random bits on a computer.
* An RNG library typically has two functions:
	* `add_entropy(randomness)` — adds randomness to the RNG's entropy pool
		* Typically called by the OS. The OS measures randomness and feeds it to the RNG.
		* Two main sources of hardware randomness:
			* Interrupt times of the CPU, which forms a random sequence.
			* Hardware also has a `rdrand` instruction that generates random bits read from the CPU.
	* `get_random()` — returns a random number
		* The RNG uses the entropy pool to generate a random number.
	* Never call `get_random()` before enough entropy has been added.
		* E.g. during boot, wait a few minutes for entropy pool to accumulate before generating a key.

## Stream Ciphers
* A stream cipher is like an OTP but uses a PRG to expand a short seed into a long pseudorandom key
* The message and ciphertext space is: $M = C = \{0, 1\}^{\leq n}$.
	* The stream cipher can be used to encrypt variable-length messages up to $n$ bits.
* The key is a truly random seed: $k \in K = \{0, 1\}^s$.
* To encrypt and decrypt, we take a slice of the PRG output:
	* The encryption function is: $E(k, m) = m \oplus G(k)[0:|m|]$
	* The decryption function is: $D(k, c) = c \oplus G(k)[0:|c|]$
* Security: if the PRG is secure, then the stream cipher is "secure".
	* This is because the adversary cannot distinguish between the output of the stream cipher and a random string.
	* Not perfectly secure like OTP (since key space is smaller than message space)
* To encrypt a stream of bits, we use **send and flush**:
	* Treat a stream of messages as one long message.
	* It will then generate a long enough key to encrypt the entire stream.

# Block Ciphers (aka PRF)
* What if we want to encrypt multiple messages using the same key? **Solution: use a block cipher.**
	* E.g. encrypt all your files using the same password.
* A block cipher defined over $(\text{key } K, \text{domain }X)$ is a pair of algorithms $(E, D)$ such that:
	* $E: K \times X \to X$
	* $D: K \times X \to X$
	* $D(k, E(k, x)) = x$ for all $k \in K$ and $x \in X$
* It operates on fixed-size blocks of $n$-bits ![Pasted image 20250116115227](Pasted%20image%2020250116115227.png)
* **Security:** Intuitively, a block cipher wants
	* For $k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} K$, the function $\hat{E}(X) := E(k, x)$ should "look like" a random one-to-one function from $X$ to $X$

## Examples
* **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard, 2001)**
	* This is the most widely used block cipher.
	* Block size $n = 128$ bits
	* Key length is either $128, 192, 256$ bits
* **3DES (Data Encryption Standard, 1972)**
	* This has been phased out because it is very slow.
	* Block size $n = 64$ bits
	* Key length is $168$ bits

## Definition
* Block ciphers are built by iteration!
	1. Get a random key $k \stackrel{R}{\leftarrow} K$
	2. Expand the key into $d + 1$ keys $k_0, k_1, \dots, k_d$
	3. Get the input $x \in X$
	4. Pass the input through $d$ rounds of the round function $R: K \times X \to X$
	5. Output the result $y = R(k_d, R(k_{d-1}, R(\dots, R(k_0, x)))) \in X$
* The round function $R(k, m)$ is invertible. **To decrypt, we just reverse the rounds.**
	* $R$ cannot be a linear function (all the rounds would compose into another linear function)
	* We want $R$ such that we converge to a secure cipher with a small number of rounds.

# AES
* Abstractly, AES is an Iterated Even-Mansour (IEM) cipher.
* The IEM is defined as a fixed and invertible function
$$
\pi: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^n \tag{$n = 128$}
$$

## Key and Round Structure
* AES always uses a 128-bit block size
* The round keys are always 128 bits, regardless of the initial key size
* Key expansion process:
	* Takes the initial key (128/192/256 bits)
	* Generates a sequence of 128-bit round keys:
		* AES-128: 11 round keys (initial + 10 rounds)
		* AES-192: 13 round keys (initial + 12 rounds)
		* AES-256: 15 round keys (initial + 14 rounds)
	* Each round key is XORed with the 128-bit block state during encryption/decryption

## Encryption and Decryption
* The encryption function is $E_{\text{IEM}}(k, x)$ where $x \in \{0, 1\}^{n}$. The steps are:
	1. Expand the key $k$ using a PRG into $d + 1$ keys $k_0, k_1, \dots, k_d \in \{0, 1\}^{n}$
	2. Take the input $x \in \{0, 1\}^{n}$ and pass it through $d$ rounds of $\pi$ with the keys
	3. Output the result $y$
![Pasted image 20250116121146](Pasted%20image%2020250116121146.png)
* The decryption function is $D_{\text{IEM}}(k, y)$ where $y \in \{0, 1\}^{n}$. The steps are:
	1. Expand the key $k$ using a PRG into $d + 1$ keys $k_0, k_1, \dots, k_d \in \{0, 1\}^{n}$
	2. Take the input $y \in \{0, 1\}^{n}$ and pass it through $d$ rounds of $\pi^{-1}$ with the keys in reverse order
	3. Output the result $x$
* We need $\pi$ because xor is linear, and we need a nonlinear function to make the cipher secure.
* We do multiple rounds of iterations because it allows us to use a simpler $\pi$.

> [!NOTE] Theorem
> If $\pi$ is fixed but chosen at random and $k_0, \dots, k_d$ are chosen at random from $\{0, 1\}^{n}$, then the cipher $(E_{\text{IEM}}, D_{\text{IEM}})$ is a "secure" block cipher provided that $n$ and $d$ are sufficiently large.

## Why AES256?
* Why couldn't we just do $2 \times \text{AES128}$ if we wanted to have a 256-bit key?
	* Bad AES256 is slow ⟶ 20 rounds for two AES128 versus 14 rounds for one AES256
	* Bad AES256 is broken ⟶ to recover both $k_1$ and $k_2$, the adversary only needs to run AES $2^{128}$ times to get the key.

# Performance Summary
* Below are the performance comparisons in software.
	* Hardware is about 20 times faster than software.
	* ChaCha20 is used on Androids because they usually have weak ciphers that don't have AES hardware support.
