# Recap
* Stream ciphers ⟶ can only use one key to encrypt **one** message
* Block ciphers ⟶ can use ony key to encrypt **many** messages
## Block Ciphers
![Pasted image 20250121105021](Pasted%20image%2020250121105021.png)
* Block ciphers are built by expanding the key into multiple subkeys, then passing it through round functions.

* The last round of AES is a bit different from the previous rounds ($\pi$ should be $\pi^`$)
	* $\pi$ is a one-to-one (permutation) function ⟶ each point in domain maps to one point in the range.
	* $\pi$ is specifically designed for this purpose ⟶ it is not a random function
	* AES is deterministic ⟶ once you've chosen your key (key is where entropy is introduced), everything from then on is deterministic.

# AES-NI
* AES is generally implemented in hardware instructions.
	* It uses 128-bit `xmm` registers to store its state and round key.
* `aeskeygenassist` will take a key and populate $d$ `xmm` registers for the $d$ round keys

* Guarantees that there is no runtime leakage; though there might be power consumption leakage.
	* The running time is **independent of the operands (the plaintext and the key)**
* We use `xmm1` to store the plaintext (and the iterated ciphertext). The keys are stored in `xmm2-xmm16`.
	* Note: there are 15 keys for 14 rounds.

## Parallelism and Pipelining
* Intel has significantly improved the performance of these AES-NI instructions.
* Pipelining ⟶ issues an `aesenc` every cycle to encrypt **multiple blocks in parallel**.
	* To encrypt 100 blocks, before it took 4 * 100 cycles. Now it takes 103 cycles.
* Vectorization ⟶ AVX instructions operate on 512 bit registers, which can hold 4 AES blocks.

## Secure PRFs
* Suppose $F$ defined over domain `X` and range `Y` is a PRF.
	* Define `Funs[X,Y]` to be a finite set of **all functions** from `X` to `Y`.
	* Define `S_f` to be the subset all functions defined by the PRF.
		* i.e. all functions from `X` to `Y` where we fix the key `k`
		* `|S_F|` is the same as the number of keys that we have in `K`

### Intuition
![Pasted image 20250121112214](Pasted%20image%2020250121112214.png)
* Indistinguishable ⟶ adversary can pick functions from a box that contains either `Funs[X,Y]` or `S_F`. **Indistinguishable** if adversary cannot tell which set the function is from.
![Pasted image 20250121112319](Pasted%20image%2020250121112319.png)
### Definition
* A **challenger** has two experiments:
	* Experiment 0 ⟶ pick a random key $k$ and define $f$ to be $F(k, \cdot)$ the PRF fixed at $k$
	* Experiment 1 ⟶ pick a truly random function $f: X\to Y$ from $\text{Funs[X, Y]}$
* The adversary can issue queries $x_i$ and get back $f(x_i)$ from the challenger.
	* The adversary then has to guess which experiment it is interacting with.
* A PRF is **secure** if no adversary can distinguish between the two experiments.
![Pasted image 20250121112908](Pasted%20image%2020250121112908.png)
* Looking at either $\text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(b)=0]$ or $\text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(b)=1]$ is acceptable.
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Adv}_{\text{PRF}}[A,F] &= |\text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(0)=1] - \text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(1)=1]| \\
&= |(1-\text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(0)=0]) - (1-\text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(1)=0])| \\
&= |\text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(1)=0] - \text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(0)=0]| \\
&= |\text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(0)=0] - \text{Pr}[\text{EXP}(1)=0]| \quad \text{(due to absolute value)}
\end{align*}
$$

## Proving a PRF is Insecure
![Pasted image 20250121113153](Pasted%20image%2020250121113153.png)
* Let $y_0 = f(x_0) = k \oplus x_o$ and $y_1 = f(x_1) = k \oplus x_1$
	* Notice that $y_0 \oplus y_1 = k \oplus x_0 \oplus k \oplus x_1 = x_0 \oplus x_1$
* Under experiment 0 (using the PRF), the adversary **always outputs 0**
* Under experiment 1 (using truly random function), the adversary outputs 0 with probability $1/2^n$ because:
	* The challenger picks $y_0$ and $y_1$ independently and uniformly at random from the range
	* For the adversary's check to pass, we need $y_0 \oplus y_1 = x_0 \oplus x_1$
	* Once $y_0$ is fixed, there is only one value of $y_1$ that satisfies this equation
	* Since $y_1$ is chosen randomly from $2^n$ possible values, the probability of choosing exactly the right value is $1/2^n$
* Since the probability is 1 in experiment 0 but only $1/2^n$ in experiment 1, an adversary can easily distinguish between the experiments, proving the function is insecure

## Secure PRPs
* This is very similar except in experiment 1, we choose a **truly random one-to-one function**

### Example Secure PRPs

## PRP-PRF Switching Lemma
* An adversary with a bounded running time cannot distinguish a PRF from a PRP.
* Implication: whenever we need a PRF, we can also use a PRP like AES.

# Semantic Security (one-time key)
1. The challenger first chooses a random key $k$ for the cipher.
2. The adversary gives the challenger two messages $m_0$ and $m_1$.
3. The challenger sends back either $c_0$ or $c_1$.
4. The adversary guesses which one it got back.
![Pasted image 20250121131953](Pasted%20image%2020250121131953.png)
* A cipher is semanticaly secure for a one-time key if the adversary cannot distinguish between $c_0$ and $c_1$ from the cipher.

* If a cipher is semantically secure, no "efficient" adversary can learn any useful information about the plaintext from a **single ciphertext**.
	* Given adversary $A$, we can build adversary $B$ that can break the cipher.

# Using PRPs and PRFs
## Incorrect Use: Electronic Code Book
* If you want to encode a movie, the most natural thing to do is:
	* Break the movie into 16 byte blocks.
	* Encrypt each block into ciphertext using AES.
	* This is called ECB mode
* **Problem:** If the same plaintext block is encrypted multiple times, the same ciphertext block is produced.
	* This means the ciphertext leaks information about the plaintext.
![Pasted image 20250121131134](Pasted%20image%2020250121131134.png)
![Pasted image 20250121131419](Pasted%20image%2020250121131419.png)

* ECB is **not semantically secure**.
	* Send two messages where each message is two blocks.
	* If `c1 = c2`, then we know that the blocks were the same, which means it must be message 1 ("Hello Hello").

## Secure Constructions
* The one-time-pad is **semantically secure** for all adversaries (even unbounded adversaries).
	* We proved already that it was perfectly secure, so it would be semantically secure too.
* The **deterministic counter mode** with AES is also secure.
![Pasted image 20250121170134](Pasted%20image%2020250121170134.png)

### Deterministic Counter Mode
* Suppose we have our large message. Break it into 16-byte blocks.
* In this mode:
	* We break our message into 16-byte blocks
	* We use a PRF to build a PRG:
		* Calculate the pad by computing $\texttt{AES}(k, 0), \texttt{AES}(k, 1), \dots, \texttt{AES}(k, L)$
	* XOR the pad with our message blocks to get the ciphertext
* Essentially, we are using AES itself as a pseudorandom generator.
![Pasted image 20250121170128](Pasted%20image%2020250121170128.png)
* To decrypt:
	* Recompute the pad using the same counter sequence
	* XOR the ciphertext with the pad to recover the message
* Note: **We don't need a PRP here** since we never need to invert the function
	* We use AES as a PRF, only using it for encryption and not decryption

* The deterministic counter-mode security theorem says:
