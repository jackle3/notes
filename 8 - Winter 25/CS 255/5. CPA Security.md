# Recap
## Block Ciphers
* Block ciphers allow you to use the same key for multiple messages.

## PRFs and PRPs

## ECB: Incorrect Use of a PRP
* Problem: encrypting same plaintext block twice produces the same ciphertext block.

# Modes of Operation for One-Time Key
* E.g. encrypted email, new key for every message.
## Semantic Security
* Advantage is:
	* probability that adversary outputs $1$ in experiment 0 versus
	* probability that adversary outputs $1$ in experiment 1

## Deterministic Counter Mode
* We use the PRF on a counter starting from $1$ to $L$.
* Effectively building a PRG from a PRF.
	* Seed is key $k$
	* We expand $k$ to a long key expansion
	* This is indistinguishable from an OTP.
* In practice, this is a stream cipher:
	* Devices without AES hardware will use ChaCha20
	* Devices with AES hardware will use det ctr mode.
* **Note: this is still a stream cipher ⟶ can only use key once.**

# Modes of Operation for Many-time Key
* E.g. File systems ⟶ same AES key used to encrypt many files
* E.g. IPsec ⟶ Same AES key used to encrypt many packets

## CPA Security
* Similar to semantic security, we define a game:
	* Challenger chooses a secret key and the **experiment $b$ is fixed**
	* The adversary can issue $q$ pairs of messages, and receive $q$ ciphertexts.
		* Messages are adaptive: adversary sends query $2$ after seeing $c_1$
![[Pasted image 20250127111048.png]]
* If the adversary wants to get the encryption of a message, they can send the same message in both pair items.
![[Pasted image 20250127111208.png]]
* The semantic security under CPA is defined via a negligible advantage.
![[Pasted image 20250127111215.png]]

## Security for Many-time Key
* **Fact**: stream ciphers are **insecure under CPA** because this is a many-time pad.
* **Fact**: if the encryption algorithm is deterministic, meaning $E(k, m)$ always produces the same ciphertext, then the cipher is **insecure under CPA**.
	* Adversary makes two queries. First query sends $m_0$ twice. Second sends $m_0$ and $m_1$. If ciphertexts differ then it is $c_1$, else $c_0$.

## Nonce-based Encryption
* Ciphers now talk a key, message, **and a nonce**
	* The nonce is *sent along with the ciphertext*. It is not secret.
* **Fact**: if the ciphertext has the same size as the plaintext, it is not CPA secure.
	* CPA security requires that ciphertext is a bit longer than plaintext.

## Construction 1: CBC with Random Nonce
* Adversary must not know IV because if he does, he can choose $m[0]$ that breaks the cipher.
![[Pasted image 20250127113010.png]]
* CBC is bad because it is sequential ⟶ we cannot parallelize encryption or decryption.
![[Pasted image 20250127113603.png]]
* $q$ is the number of queries made by adversary ⟶ corresponds to number of times you are using the key.

## Construction 1a: CBC with Unique Nonce
* Run another round of the cipher $E(k_2, IV)$ to turn IV to IV', which is effectively a random nonce.
	* Use another key $k_2$ here! If $k_1 = k_2$, this is fully insecure.

## Construction 2: Rand Ctr-mode
* This is again the stream cipher from det ctr-mode.
	* However, the counter now starts at $IV$ where $IV$ is chosen fully at random.
	* All 128 bits of the $IV$ nonce is random.
![[Pasted image 20250127114651.png]]
* Benefits:
	* Parallelizable and much simpler
	* Don't need decryption ⟶ only need to encrypt the IV to make a PRG.
![[Pasted image 20250127115306.png]]
* This is CPA secure as long as the ranges $\texttt{IV}_i, \dots, \texttt{IV}_{i} +L$ do not intersect.
![[Pasted image 20250127115705.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250127115759.png]]

## Construction 2a: Nonce Ctr-mode
* The top 96 bits is the nonce (random)
* The bottom 32 bits is used for the counter
![[Pasted image 20250127120114.png]]
## Comparison: CBC Vs Ctr-mode
* Always use counter-mode.

# Attacks on Block Ciphers
![[Pasted image 20250127120938.png]]

## 1. Linear and Differential Attacks
![[Pasted image 20250127121050.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250127121059.png]]
* Linear cryptanalysis looks at relationships between bits:
	* We take some bits from the message and some bits from the ciphertext
	* We XOR these bits together
	* We compare this result to some bits from the key
	* In a secure cipher, this relationship should look random
		* The probability should be 50/50 (1/2) that the XOR equals the key bits
			* this is because in a secure cipher, the relationship between input bits, output bits, and key bits should appear completely random.
			* When something is truly random, each possible outcome (0 or 1) should occur with equal probability (50% each)
		* If it's not 1/2, we found a "linear bias" that could help break the cipher
	* For example, if XORing the first bit of message with last bit of ciphertext equals the middle bit of the key 75% of the time, that's a serious weakness.
