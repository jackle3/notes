# Recap: Symmetric Cyptography
* Alice and Bob have a shared key $k$ and want to communicate.

1. If we only need data integrity, we use a MAC to create a tag on the message.
2. If we need confidentiality, we need to use an Authenticated Encryption cipher (e.g. AES-GCM)
	* This ensures both confidentiality and integrity.
	* Confidentiality without integrity is not confidential.

# Basic Key Exchange
* **Main Question**: Where does the shared key come from?
	* Answer: key exchange protocol.
* In the past:
	* Alice and Bob physically come together (out-of-band) and share the keys physically
	* This is not really possible on the internet.

## Method 1: Online Trusted Third-Party (TTP)
* Alice, Bob, Carol, and David want to set up shared keys with each other.

### Setup
* They first set up a shared key with the TTP ⟶ this key is shared out-of-band.

### Key Exchange
* This is a toy protocol that is secure against eavesdropping ⟶ don't need MAC
* We need a CPA-secure cipher $(E, D)$ with key space $K$

* If Alice wants a shared key with Bob:
	1. Alice goes to TTP and asks for a key with Bob
	2. TTP generates a random shared key $k_{ab}$
	3. TTP sends to Alice:
		* the key $c_1 := E(k_a, k_{ab})$
		* the ticket $c_2 := E(k_b, k_{ab})$
	4. Alice sends the ticket $c_2$ to Bob.
		* Alice can remember this ticket to continue communicating with Bob
		* In Kerberos, this ticket lasts for about 8 hours
	5. Now both can decrypt the key $k_{ab}$ with their own keys.

### Why is This Secure?
* The eavesdropper sees:
	* $c_1 := E(k_a, k_{ab})$
	* $c_2 := E(k_b, k_{ab})$
* Because $(E, D)$ is CPA secure, the eavesdropper cannot learn anything about $k_{ab}$ from these ciphertexts.

### Problems
1. TTP is involved in every key exchange ⟶ single point of failure
2. TTP knows all the shared session keys $k_{ab}$ ⟶ TTP can decrypt any traffic, backdoor heaven
3. Caveat: this is the basics of the Kerberos system ⟶ often used in corporations, but giving corporations a way to eavesdrop on all their own enterprise traffic is fine

### Insecure against Active Adversaries
* This is insecure against active adversaries ⟶ those who can inject or drop packets.
* Replay Attack:
	* Suppose Alice talks to the Bank, they have a shared $k_{ab}$
	* Alice sends a message to Bank "Sent \$100 to Carol" encrypted with $k_{ab}$
	* Eve can intercept this ciphertext and send the message again.
	* Bank sees two requests, Alice loses \$200
* **Solution**: Make Bank reply to Alice's ticket with a random value $t$ that changes frequently (e.g. per day)
	* The key is now $k_{ab} || t$ where $t$ is random value
	* Eve can't replay the message because $t$ changes and Eve does not know $t$

## Method 2: Shared Key without TTP
* Merkle (1974): You can do key exchange using only symmetric primitives (i.e. AES)
	* Protocol was quadratic ⟶ if we want the security for time $t^2$, the user needs to work for time $t$
		* I.e. we need to work for time $2^{64}$ to set up a shared key that takes $2^{128}$ to break
	* Problem: this is very impactical

* To get an exponential protocol, we need more structure!
	* Diffie-Hellman (1976)
	* RSA (1977)
	* Elliptic Curve Cryptography (1984)
	* Lattice Key Exchange (2008) ⟶ post quantum secure

# Basic Diffie-Hellman Protocol
* This version provides only eavesdropping security.
	* Alice and Bob send messages over the open internet
	* Eve can see all the messages
	* By the end, Alice has $k_{ab}$ and Bob has $k_{ab}$ and Eve has no clue what it is.
![[Pasted image 20250213163827.png]]
* To do so, we need to create an **asymmetry between Alice/Bob and Eve** ⟶ randomness

## Setup
1. Public parameters:
	1. Fix a large prime $p$ that is 600 digits or so
	2. Fix an integer $g$ that is $1 \leq g < p$
2. Per-person setup:
	1. Alice will choose a random integer $a \in \{1, \ldots, p - 1\}$
	2. Bob will choose a random integer $b \in \{1, \ldots, p - 1\}$
3. Communication:
	1. Alice will send $A := g^a (\text{mod } p)$
	2. Bob will send $B := g^b (\text{mod } p)$
4. Shared Key:
	1. Bob calculates $k_{ab} = A^b = (g^a)^b (\text{mod } p) = g^{a \times b} (\text{mod } p)$
	2. Alice calculates $k_{ab} = B^a = (g^b)^a (\text{mod } p) = g^{b \times a} (\text{mod } p)$
	3. Both sides obtain the shared key is $k_{ab} := g^{a \times b} (\text{mod } p)$

## Eavesdropping Security
* The adversary can see $\{ g, p, A = g^a, B = g^b \}$ but cannot find $a$ or $b$ because of the $\text{mod } p$
	* Without the $\text{mod } p$, we can directly $\log$ the $A$ and $B$ to get $a$ and $b$
	* With it, we have the **Discrete Log Problem**: given $g^a \bmod p$, find $a$ ⟶ this is computationally hard when $p$ is a large prime. No efficient algorithm is known to recover $a$ or $b$ from $g^a \bmod p$ or $g^b \bmod p$
* **Goal**: Can the adversary compute $g^{a\times b} (\text{mod } p)$

* The function is $\text{DH}_g (g^a, g^b) = g^{a \times b} (\text{mod } p)$
	* How hard is it to compute $\text{DH}_g (A, B)$?

* If $p$ is an n-bit prime (e.g. $n = 2048$), the best algorithm to compute $\text{DH}_g (A, B)$ is GNFS
	* The runtime is $O(e^{\sqrt[3]{n}}) \ll O(2^n)$
* This means we need very large $n$ to make our cipher key sizes secure (i.e. runtime roughly $2^{128}$)
	* Problem: arithmetic modulo prime is roughly an $O(n^2)$ operation on $n$-bit primes
	* Solution: a variant called Elliptic Curve Diffie Helman

## Insecure against Active Adversaries
* Basic Diffie-Hellman is insecure against active adversaries — man in the middle attacks
	* Alice sends $A = g^a \bmod p$ to Bob. Eve intercepts this and sends $A' = g^{a'} \bmod p$ to Bob.
	* Bob sends $B = g^b \bmod p$ to Alice. Eve intercepts this and sends $B' = g^{b'} \bmod p$ to Alice.
* Now, Alice will communicate with $g^{a \times b'} \bmod p$ and Bob will communicate with $g^{a' \times b} \bmod p$
* **Key Idea**: Alice thinks she established a shared key with Bob, but it was actually with Eve
	* Adversary can now decrypt and forward messages between Alice and Bob

# Arithmetic mod P
* On a 32-bit computer, large numbers are stored in multiple "limbs":
	* An $n$-bit number is split into $\lceil n/32 \rceil$ chunks of 32 bits each (called limbs)
![[Pasted image 20250215220815.png]]
* Arithmetic operations must be performed limb by limb:
	* Addition/Subtraction: $O(n)$ time
		* Process each limb once, carrying over as needed
	* Multiplication: $O(n^2)$ time
		* Must multiply each limb with every other limb
		* Then sum up all partial products (requires $n$ $n$-bit additions)
	* Modulo: $k \bmod n$ is $O(n^2)$ time
		* Similar complexity to multiplication
	* **Note**: $n$ is the number of bits in the value. I.e. this is same as $O(\log_2 x)$ where $x$ is an $n$-bit number
* Note: if given a squaring algorithm we can construct a multiplication algorithm that is only a bit slower
![[Pasted image 20250215221532.png]]

## Modular Exponentiation
* We want to compute $g^x \bmod p$. Use **repeated squaring** algorithm:
	1. Suppose we want to compute $g^{13}$. We can write 13 in binary as $1101_2$. This means we can write $13$ as a sum of powers of 2.
	2. This means $g^{13} = g^{1101_2} = g^8 \times g^4 \times g^1$
	3. Now, you can start with $g^1$ and keep squaring it to get $g^2, g^4, g^8, \ldots$
	4. We can then pick out the ones we want and multiply them together to get $g^{13}$.

### Repeated Squaring Algorithm
1. Let $x = x_n x_{n-1} \ldots x_1 x_0 \in \{0, 1\}^{n+1}$ be the binary representation of $x$
2. Set $z \leftarrow 1$ and $y \leftarrow g$
3. For $i$ from $0$ to $n$:
	1. If $x_i = 1$, set $z \leftarrow z \times y \bmod p$
	2. Set $y \leftarrow y^2 \bmod p$
4. Output $z$

### Runtime
* We have at most $2 \times \log_2(x)$ multiplications (for $z$ and $y$)
	* Each multiplication is $O(n^2)$ time
	* Since $x$ is an $n$-bit number, $\log_2(x) = n$
* If $x \approx p$ where $p$ is an $n$-bit prime, then:
	* Number of multiplications = $O(n)$
	* Each multiplication costs $O(n^2)$ time
	* Total runtime is $O(n^3)$
