Course work: 4 HWs + 2 Projects (3 late days)
Final exam: March 18
There are sections every Friday
# Course Overview
- **Goal:** how crypto works and how to use them correctly.
- Cryptography is the science of protecting information (not the crypto from the news)
	- The only thing secret in crypto is the secret key ⟶ everything else should be assumed to be public, including the cryptographic algorithm.
## Future Courses
- CS 251 — blockchains
- CS 155 — computer and network security
- CS 356 — advanced security topics
- CS 355 — advanced crypto (zero-knowledge proofs)
## Places Where Crypto is Used
**TLS and SSH**
- When browsing web, we are using TLS ⟶ purpose of this course is to basically explain all the cryptography components of TLS.
- When remote connecting, we use SSH ⟶ secure shell
- Steps are:
	1. Session setup (using **public key cryptography** and certificates, DH, RSA, etc)
		- Goal is to share the secret key used to encrypt and decrypt information.
	2. Using a **shared secret key**, we encrypt/decrypt for privacy + integrity
		- Symmetric ciphers
**Secure chat (signal, iMessage, etc)**
- Main challenge is that one of the parties might be offline when the message is sent.
- How do we transfer keys and set up connections?
	- Answer is using your public key (**key transparency**)
**Encrypted file systems**
- Encrypted using symmetric encryption
**Wireless**
- 802.11 (WEP, WPA2, WPA3)
	- WEP is bad lol

# Ciphers
## Symmetric Ciphers
- Both parties know the secret key ⟶ use the same key
- Use a pair of algorithms `E` and `D` to encrypt and decrypt a message.
	- `E` takes message $M$ and produces ciphertext $C$ using shared key $K$
	- `D` takes ciphertext $C$ and produced plaintext $M$

## Definition
A cipher is defined over (Key, Message, Ciphertext) is a pair of efficient algorithms (E and D) where:
$$
E: K \times M \to C
$$
$$
D: K \times C \to M
$$
such that $\forall m \in M, \forall k \in K\to D(k, E(k, m)) = m$ where "efficient" means runs in polynomial time.

Note:
- $E(k, m)$ can be a randomized algorithm ⟶ running on same input twice might produce different outputs (e.g. via nonce/tag)
- $D(k, m)$ is deterministic

## Example: Substitution Cipher
The secret key just substitutes certain letters for other letters in the alphabet.
- Possible number of keys is $|K| = 26!$

### To Break
- use the frequency of letters to connect ciphertext to plaintext
![[Pasted image 20250106154340.png|800]]
- use the frequency of letter pairs to do the same

## Example: One-time Pad
### Key Details
- View messages and ciphers as bits ⟶ $|M| = |C| = |K| = \{0, 1\}^n$
- The secret key is a random bit string $k \in K$
- The algorithms are simply use xor (addition modulo 2)
	- $c := E(k, m) = k \oplus m$
	- $m := D(k, m) = k \oplus c$
- Pro: extremely fast encryption and decryption

### To Verify This Algorithm
$$
\begin{align*}
D(k, E(k, m)) &= D(k, k \oplus m) \\
&= k \oplus (k \oplus m) \\
&= (k \oplus k) \oplus m \\
&= 0 \oplus m \\
&= m
\end{align*}
$$
### Problems
- The key has to be same size as the message.
- The key can only be used to encrypt one message.

## Theorem of Info Security (Shannon 1949)
- The goal of a secure cipher is that the **ciphertext reveals nothing about the plaintext.**
	- Exception: it's fine if the ciphertext reveals the length of the plaintext.

> [!NOTE] Theorem (Shannon 1949)
> A cipher provides **perfect secrecy** against a ciphertext-only attack if the plaintext and the ciphertext, considered as random variables, are independent.

> [!NOTE] Definition
> A cipher `(E, D)` over $(K, M, C)$ has **perfect secrecy** if
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> &\forall m_{0}, m_{1} \in M \quad \text{where } len(m_{0}) = len(m_{1}), \\\\
> &\forall c \in C.\\
> &Pr[E(k, m_{0}) = c] = Pr[E(k, m_{1}) = c]
> \end{align*}
> $$
> where $k$ is uniform in $K$.
>
> In other words, the probability of $m_0$ encrypting to $c$ is the same as $m_1$ encrypting to $c$.  After adversary observes $c$, he can't tell if message is $m_0$ or $m_1$.
>
> The random variable $C$ (representing the ciphertext) is independent of the random variable $M$ (representing the plaintext).

### Properties
- For secure ciphers, it is impossible to break the cipher regardless of how much computational power you have.
- **Theorem**: If a cipher has perfect secrecy, then $|K| \geq |M|$
	- This suggests that the OTP is optimal - we cannot do better than using keys as long as messages
	- *Proof:*
		- Fix any ciphertext $c \in C$
		- For each message $m \in M$, there must exist at least one key $k_m \in K$ such that $E(k_m, m) = c$
			- Otherwise, if no such key existed for some message $m_0$, then $Pr[E(k, m_0) = c] = 0$ 
			- But for any other message $m_1$, there must be some nonzero probability $Pr[E(k, m_1) = c] > 0$
			- This would violate perfect secrecy since the probabilities are not equal
		- The keys $k_m$ must all be distinct
			- If $k_{m_1} = k_{m_2}$ for $m_1 \neq m_2$, then $E(k_{m_1}, m_1) = E(k_{m_2}, m_2) = c$
			- This means $D(k_{m_1}, c)$ would decrypt to both $m_1$ and $m_2$, which is impossible
		- Therefore, we need at least $|M|$ distinct keys in $K$, so $|K| \geq |M|$

## Proving that OTP is Perfect Secure
**Lemma:** OTP has perfect secrecy
**Proof:**
$$
\forall m \in M, c \in C
$$
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{For uniformly random }&k \in K \\
&\to Pr[E(k, m) = c] &= \frac{\text{number of keys $k$ st $E(k, m) = c$}}{|K|} \\
&&= \frac{\text{number of keys $k$ st $k \oplus m = c$}}{|K|}
\end{align*}
$$
For the OTP, we now that $k\oplus m =c \implies c \oplus m = k$
- There can only exists one key $k$ that satisfies $c \oplus m$
- Therefore, we know that $Pr[E(k, m) = c] = \frac{1}{|K|}$
- We know that $K = \{0, 1\}^n$ so $|K| = 2^n$.
Therefore, $\forall m \in M, c \in C$, we know that $Pr[E(k, m) = c] = \frac{1}{|K|} = 2^{1/n}$
