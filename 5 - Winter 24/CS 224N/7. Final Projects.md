# Where to find papers

- Look at ACL anthology for NLP papers:
    - [https://aclanthology.org/](https://aclanthology.org/)
- Also look at the online proceedings of major ML conferences:
    - NeurIPS [https://papers.nips.cc](https://papers.nips.cc/), ICML, ICLR [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc)
- Look at past cs224n projects
    - [http://cs224n.stanford.edu/](http://cs224n.stanford.edu/)
- Look at online preprint servers, especially:
    - [https://arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/)
- Even better: look for an interesting problem in the world!
    - Hal Varian: How to Build an Economic Model in Your Spare Time
    - [https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/how.pdf](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/how.pdf)
