# Strict Diagonal Dominance

- A matrix where the absolute value of the diagonals is greater than the absolute value of everything in its row and column

# Symmetric Matrices

- Recall from the SVD that $Av_k = \sigma_k u_k$﻿, where $A = U \Sigma V^T$﻿ and $v_k$﻿ is a column of $V$﻿

- For symmetric matrices, you can make $U$﻿ and $V$﻿ identical, giving us the eigensystem diagonalization form of $A = V \Lambda V^T$﻿
- For symmetric matrices, the singular values are simply just the absolute value of the eigenvalues.

## Making/Breaking Symmetry

- You can row and column scale a matrix to make it into a symmetric matrix.

## Symmetric Approximation

![Untitled 4 35.png](attachments/Untitled%204%2035.png)

- This is an example of where precondition comes in. You can get an approximate of the for the inverse of $A$﻿ using the inverse of the symmetric $\hat{A}$﻿

# Inner Product

- You can weight an inner product by incorporating a matrix into it.
    - This also allows you to take inner pro ducts when $u$﻿ and $v$﻿ have different lengths, since you can change the dimensions of the matrix $A$﻿

# Definiteness

- We only care about definiteness for symmetric matrices.
    - Eigenvalues and singular values are interchangeable for symmetric matrices.

- Positive definite is when the weighted inner product is positive.
    - $A$﻿ can’t have any null space stuff, and it can’t have any negative eigenvalues.
- Positive semi-definite is when the weighted inner product is non-negative.
    - $A$﻿ can have a zero eigenvalue or singluar value, so it might not be invertible. However, it still does not have any negatives.

- Negative definiteness is the same as above, just flipped. In reality, most people just replace $A$﻿ with $-A$﻿ and talk about the positive definiteness instead.

- $A$﻿ is considered indefinite if there is a mixture between positive and negative eigenvalues.

## Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) Matrices

![Untitled 11 32.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%2032.png)

- Since the SVD has $U = V$﻿, the equation $Ac = b$﻿ has $c$﻿ and $b$﻿ starting out in the exact same space.
    - This is because $U^T (U \Sigma V^T c) = U^T b$﻿ equals $\Sigma (V^T c) = V^T b$﻿
- SPD matrices don’t require pivoting during LU factorization
- A symmetric (strictly) diagonally dominant matrix with positive diagonal entries is positive definite.

# Cholesky Factorization

- This only works if the matrix is SPD. It allows you to get LU without elimination.

## Incomplete Cholesky Preconditioner

- Again, preconditioning means we can get an approximate inverse, and use that to make a better conditioned matrix to solve our system with.
