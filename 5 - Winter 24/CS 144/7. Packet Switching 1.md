# Recap

- TCP has it’s own copy of UDP inside of each TCP segment.

- TCP is layered directly on top of internet datagrams.

## Stack

- A lot of service abstractions are built on top of TCP.

![Untitled 1 97.png](../../attachments/Untitled%201%2097.png)

- Note that each of the service abstractions can layer on top of each other as well. TLS is basically just TCP but encripted, so all of the TCP stuff can also be layered on TLS.

## HTTP/2

- This is basically using 1 single byte stream to send data for multiple bytestreams.
- We define a format for the data, which allows us to easy read and decipher data.

## TLS/SSL

- Very similar to traditional TCP.
    - Instead of taking in a reliable byte stream of plaintext and sending out another reliable bytestream of plaintext,
    - It takes in a reliable byte stream of plaintext and sends out another reliable bytestream of ciphertext.
- Used for encryption and authentication.
- It can do everything that a regular TCP bidirectional bytestream can do.
- It can also be layered on itself, encapsulating TLS segments inside of other TLS segments.

- HTTPS is just like regular HTTP but sent through TLS instead of TCP.

# Circuit Switching

- Circuit-switched networks (e.g. telephones)
    - Each telephone is connected to a center office
    - And a staff worked in the office would connect the wires upon customers’ request to make a circuit between you and the person you want to call
    - If the person you want to call does not belong to the same office as you, there are circuits between main offices
    - Any phone call has a real direct electrical circuit
    - BUT: setting up and tearing down circuit is expensive, it works for telephone calls, but would not make sense if you only want to send a short piece of data
- Dominant mode of communication until around 1995

# Packet Switching

- Similar to circuit switching:
    - Instead of the an operator connecting calls on human timescales, it’s sending tiny pieces of data on computer timescales
- Note that this is way below the internet layer. We’re basically sending packets along electrical fiber optic wires.
- When we put a datagram on the internet, how long does it take for it to get delivered?

# Propagation Delay

- The time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver
- There is a finite speed in the world that information can be propagated.
    - There is a guaranteed delay, such as the speed of light, that delays the transfer of information.

![Untitled 4 92.png](../../attachments/Untitled%204%2092.png)

- Speed is distance over time, so time is **distance over speed**. Note that $c$﻿ is the speed ofx light in that medium, not just the speed of light.

- We can use this to guess the ping time → the delay between sending a message and getting a response.
    
    ![Untitled 6 91.png](../../attachments/Untitled%206%2091.png)
    
    - The first `* 2` is because ping is going there and back, so we need to double it.
    - The second `* 2` is because we most likely are not going a straight line of 6000 miles, so we estimate that its double the distance.

    - This is the true ping to get to London.

# Serialization Delay

- The time it takes for a message to be placed onto the transmission medium.
- Depends on the size of the packet → the bigger the packet, the more time it takes to travel

![Untitled 8 82.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2082.png)

- Notice that the units of this is `bits / s`, where `r` is the data rate.
- The calculation is the size of the packet divided by the data rate, giving you the time.
    
    ![Untitled 9 78.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2078.png)
    
    - From the first bit to the last bit of the 64 bytes (512 bits), it will take 13 microseconds when going over a 40 megabit/s data rate.
    - This is mega**bits** per second, not mega**bytes** per second.
- In most network scenarios, the serialization delay is usually much smaller than the propagation delay.

# Total time to send a packet

- Remember that kilo is 10^3, mega is 10^6, and giga is 10^9
- The total time to send a packet is the summation of the propagation delay and the serialization delay.

## Example

![Untitled 12 70.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%2070.png)

- The serialization delay is:
    - (1000 bytes) / (1 Mbit/s) = (8000 bits) / (10^6 Bits/s) = 0.008 seconds = 8 ms
    - This is the time it takes for the sender to send the full packet.
- The propagation delay is:
    - (1 kilometer) / (c) = (1000 m) / (2e8 m/s) = 0.000005 seconds = 8 microseconds
    - This is the time it takes until the first bit gets delivered to the receiver.

![Untitled 13 68.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%2068.png)

- The sender is sending 1Mbit/s, and the receiver is also reading 1Mbit/s. The offset between them is the propagation delay.

## Sending multiple packets

- Suppose now the sender is sending multiple packets.
- The only thing that gets multiplied is the serialization delay → the propagation delay would not be multiplied.
- We can treat it kind of like a really long packet.

![Untitled 14 64.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2014%2064.png)

- The packets are transmittable back to back. There is no difference in the propagation delay.

# End-to-end Delay

- Now suppose instead of going from sender to the receiver, we now take multiple hops.

![Untitled 15 62.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2015%2062.png)

- The intermediate routers have to store the packet, and then forward it to the next router.
    - This means the router has to **receive the packet in full**, before sending it off again. This means both the propagation and serialization delay is multiplied.

![Untitled 16 58.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2016%2058.png)

- In the example above, it takes two serialization delays and two propagation delays.
