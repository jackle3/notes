# Recap of Era 6: Proxy Server

- This is the left side:
    
    - The left is the user, and the middle is going to the ISP.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 125.png|Untitled 125.png]]
    
    - The **jump host** is the one true global IP-address that is assigned to your house
        - The DHCP server of the ISP assigns this.
    - Computers inside the house have a **private** IP-address, only meaningful within the home network itself.
        - The jump host has both a global IP-address and a local IP-address. It’s usually something like `10.0.0.1`.
- This is the right side.
    
    - The middle is the ISP, the right is the service.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 1 89.png|Untitled 1 89.png]]
    
- This is **multiplexing**. The jump-host multiplexes a single global IP address to a bunch of local private IP addresses.

## Connecting TCP Socket

- There’s a few steps we need to do to connect a computer inside your home to a computer on the internet.
- **First,** your computer needs to connect to the jump host.
    
    - There are two sockets. One on your computer and on the jump host.
    - The local address is the computer’s private address. The remote address is the private side of the jump host.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 2 89.png|Untitled 2 89.png]]
    
    - In the byte stream, the computer would send something like `CONNECT 1.2.3.4 443` to the jump host. This tells it to connect to YouTube, which has the address `1.2.3.4` , on HTTPs (port `443`).
- In response to what the computer sent, **the jump host will open a new socket** to internet.
    
    - The local address is the jump host’s global IP. The remote is the desired server.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 3 89.png|Untitled 3 89.png]]
    
    - This socket will send a SYN flag over the internet to YouTube.
- On YouTube’s end, it needs to already have a listening socket open.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 4 85.png|Untitled 4 85.png]]
    
- Once YouTube receives the jump host’s SYN, it will **accept** it and create a new socket that connects to the jump host.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 5 85.png|Untitled 5 85.png]]
    

## Sending Bytes

![[attachments/Untitled 6 84.png|Untitled 6 84.png]]

- Here is what the structure looks like right now.

![[attachments/Untitled 7 81.png|Untitled 7 81.png]]

- When the jump host receives a packet from YouTube, it will do TCPReceiver stuff to it.
    - An application on the jump host will then write bytes into the socket on the private side.
- When the jump host receives a packet from the computer, it will also do TCPReceiver stuff.
    - An application will then write bytes from the private side to the public side.
- The jump host **multiplexes the connection** between the local and global networks.
    - It uses the other fields on the socket as the multiplexing key. This includes the local IP, local port, global IP, global port.

## Eras 6a: Virtual Private Network (VPNs)

- Suppose there was some company on the ISP’s network that owned the range `4.5.6.0/24`.
    - This company would be like the VPN company.
    - Left side of image graph.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 8 76.png|Untitled 8 76.png]]
        
    - Right side of image graph.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 9 72.png|Untitled 9 72.png]]
        
- If you want to mask your own IP address as another IP address that belongs to that company, you have to use **encapsulation.**
    - You would send an IP datagram to the jump host.
    - The jump host will send it to the company.
    - The company would deencapsulate it and send it to YouTube.
- The stack would look like this:
    
    - You create the data that you want to send inside an HTTP request.
    - This request is inside a TCP segment.
    - This TCP segment is inside an IP datagram. The source is the company, and the destination is YouTube.
        - We want this datagram to be on the internet itself. However, we’re still in the private subnet.
        - The second IP datagram with the `dest: 4.5.6.1` is like the `CONNECT 4.5.6.1` message from before. It tells the jump host where to forward it.
    - To get it on the internet, we encapsulate the IP datagram in a UDP datagram to be used for sending.
        - The UDP likely just tells the company what customer it is, and other information.
    - This UDP datagram is inside an outermose IP datagram. This one is being sent from the local computer to the local side of the jump host.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 10 68.png|Untitled 10 68.png]]
    
- When this datagram reaches the jump host, only the lower most IP header will be changed.
    
    - This datagram will now be forwarded from the jump host to the company.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 11 66.png|Untitled 11 66.png]]
    
- When the datagram goes across the internet to the company, the company will deencapsulate it.
    
    - This leaves it with just the HTTP, TCP, and IP part.
    - The company sends this to YouTube.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 12 65.png|Untitled 12 65.png]]
    
- When the company receives a reply, it will encapsulate it again.
    - It will put it inside a UDP with identifying information.
    - It will put that inside an IP, and send that to the jump host.
- This allows **local computers to have real global IP addresses,** in addition to their own private local address.
    
    - They are on the internet by means of a **tunnel**. It is going through the company.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 13 63.png|Untitled 13 63.png]]
    
    - The company is the one doing the multiplexing now.
        - The VPN company is the one giving you the global IP address. The jump host exists because the ISP might not want to give you many IP addreses. They only give each customer one, making the jump host necessary.

# Era 7: Transparent Proxy

![[attachments/Untitled 14 59.png|Untitled 14 59.png]]

- This is a version of Era 6, where the computer itself does not know about the existence of the jump host / proxy.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 15 57.png|Untitled 15 57.png]]
    
    - The jump host tricks the computer into thinking it’s already on the internet.
    - Every packet in the subnet has to pass through the jump host, so the jump host can change the packet at will.
- To connect to YouTube, instead of opening a connection to the jump host, the computer will open a connection directly to YouTube.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 16 54.png|Untitled 16 54.png]]
    
- The jump host tricks the computer into thinking it is YouTube.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 17 51.png|Untitled 17 51.png]]
    
    - It will read whatever bytes were sent to YouTube by the computer, and put that into a different socket. The other socket is the public one that’s actually connected to YouTube.
    - The jump host is **accepting** and acting as the peer of every incoming connection from the home subnet. It opens a new connection for each of these to forward these outside.
- The advantage is that the computer now does not have to do any configuration. It thinks that it’s on the internet already, so it just works like normal.
    - The transparent proxy does the translation in the background.

# Era 8: network address and port translation (NAPT)

- This is just an optimization over era 7, since the work of the transparent proxy in translating is kinda annoying.
    - The proxy server has to read in bytes from the computer, reassemble the bytestream, then send that to another socket to be sent out.

![[attachments/Untitled 18 49.png|Untitled 18 49.png]]

- It would be more efficient to just let TCP do it’s work. YouTube and the computer is responsible for reassembling their streams.

![[attachments/Untitled 19 45.png|Untitled 19 45.png]]

- Instead of creating a pair of connected sockets, one for the private subnet and one for the global network:
    
    - It just looks at the header and modifies the addresses, the port numbers, and the segments.
    - Simply transforms the datagram from the private one into the public one, or vice-versa.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 20 44.png|Untitled 20 44.png]]
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 21 40.png|Untitled 21 40.png]]
    
- When the `NAPT` sees that the computer is trying to open a new connection to the internet, it will establish a translation rule.
    - Essentially the same thing as what the proxy was doing, but now there’s no TCP sockets in the middle. It simply translates stuff.

![[attachments/Untitled 22 36.png|Untitled 22 36.png]]

## Multiple Computers

- Suppose there are multiple computers trying to connect to YouTube on the local network.
    - The `NAPT` will create a translation rule for each of these computers. Note that it will have to choose a different port number on the global side.

![[attachments/Untitled 23 33.png|Untitled 23 33.png]]

- Notice that it translates not just the address but also the port number.

![[attachments/Untitled 24 31.png|Untitled 24 31.png]]

## Home Router

- Often, modern routers perform all of these things.
    - It has an AP, a NAPT, a DNS server, a DHCP server on the private side.
    - It’s also a DHCP client on the public side.
    - It also has a cable modem that connects it to the ISP and the internet.

![[attachments/Untitled 25 28.png|Untitled 25 28.png]]

## Downsides

- The trigger for the NAPT to establish a translation rule in the table is when it sees that something **inside the local network is trying to connect to the global** network.
    - If the outside network is trying to connect to the inside computer, the NAPT has no clue how to do this, because the `dst` of the incoming will just be the one global IP address.
        - It can’t create rules when given incoming connections.

# Eras 9: Peer-to-peer

- We want to be able to establish P2P connections. It should work when the inside is the establishing it, as well as when the outside is the one establishing it.

## Eras 9a: public server

- We can simply use a public server to hold the files shared between the peers.
    - The peers are the PCs behind the NAPTs.

![[attachments/Untitled 26 25.png|Untitled 26 25.png]]

## Eras 9b: via public proxy/relay/ TURN

- We can agree for both peers to connect to some public server.

![[attachments/Untitled 27 23.png|Untitled 27 23.png]]

- On the left side, the computer would go through NAPT and connect to the company.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 28 21.png|Untitled 28 21.png]]
    
- On the right side, the other peer would go through NAPT and connect to the company.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 29 20.png|Untitled 29 20.png]]
    
- The company would then connect these two sockets and send bytes between them.
    
    - The company is acting as a relay for the connection. This is **Traversal Using Relays around NAPT (TURN)**
    - This is how a significant part of Zoom and Facetime works. Zoom runs the TURN server, and you and your peer connect to that server, and it acts as a relay.
        - This is really expensive for the company. They have to pay to receive packets from one peer, and pay to send packets to the other peer.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 30 20.png|Untitled 30 20.png]]
    

## Eras 9b: port forwarding

- Another method is to assign one of the ports of the public global IP address to be forwarded to a specific computer.
    
    - To do so, we can manually create a translation rule for that port.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 31 17.png|Untitled 31 17.png]]
    
    - When any incoming connection goes to port `443`, forward that to computer `10.0.0.2` on port `9876`.
        - This rule can only apply to one rule and one computer. That one computer gets all of the connections on that port.
        - This is because the only multiplexing key is the port number `443`. The global IP address is fixed, and the remote address is a **wildcard.**
            - Wildcard means that whatever goes in on one end is just set to be the thing on the other end.

![[attachments/Untitled 32 17.png|Untitled 32 17.png]]

- If we add the NAPT rule to the NAPT @ 24.9.3.7 before the TCP Connection is started, then a direct TCP Connection can be established between the two PC behind NAPTs.
