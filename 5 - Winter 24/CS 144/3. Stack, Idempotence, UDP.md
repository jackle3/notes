# IP and UDP datagrams

![[attachments/Untitled 126.png|Untitled 126.png]]

- The fundamental difference between UDP and IP is that UDP is port-to-port (between unprivileged user programs) and IP is host-to-host/computer-to-computer (entities have internet addresses),

# Stack

- The protocol stack is a sequence of modules where each module only communicates with the layer 1-level upper and lower from it through service abstraction.

- Data is prepended to the datagram as you move further down the stack.
    - The user asks a question to the reliable Q&A, which is the first payload.
    - That payload becomes the payload of the UDP datagram, which adds headers (src and dest ports to deliver it to another program)
    - That UDP payload then becomes the payload of the IP datagram
- The Q&A service is easy to implement because the questions are **idempotent**.

## Layering

- Abstract layers so that the user only has to know about the layer that they’re interacting with.
- Modules encapsulate functionality of the other modules that they depend on, abstracting them out for the user.

- The protocol number and the “to:” address are examples of multiplexing
    - The protocol identifies which program the payload goes to (e.g. sends it to UDP)
    - The to: address tells us what host the datagram goes to.
- Notice that each datagram protocol also has a checksum.

## Protocol

- The protocol field in the header tells us what program the datagram is meant for. It’s just a number.
- Common protocols are listed in `/etc/protocols`
    - For example, UDP has protocol number 17

## De-encapsulation

- When a host receives this internet datagram, it de-encapsulates it layer-by-layer.

- Each of the service abstractions from the stack tells us how to de-encapsulate.

## Root access

- It’s necessary to have root access when working with datagrams because the privileged kernel is the one who reads the datagram and decides what port, process, etc to direct the datagram towards.

# Idempotence

- Instructions that have the same result if you do it once or a billion times
    - Examples include read-only operations, or state changes like absolute value that gives the same result regardless of how many times you apply it.
- Even though UDP is unreliable, it can become reliable if the instructions we send to it are idempotent.
    - If we send a query and don’t receive a reply, just send another query until we receive a reply.

# Checksum

- To fix the issue of wrong or truncated contents that happen accidentally, we can include a checksum in the header to check for this.
- The checksum that is delievered is correct if the total # of bytes in the header plus the checksum is equal to zero.
    - In reality, a bit more complicated than that.

# Example of UDP usage: Host

- The command `host cs144.keithw.org`, which tells you the IP-address of the site, is built on top of UDP

- It sends a UDP requests with the src port being a random port (representing the shell), and the destination port being port 53 (the port of the DNS).
    - You can see the list of common services and their ports in `\etc\services`
- Since the request to UDP is read-only (ie. just looking for the IP address associated with the domain name), this program becomes reliable because it can just keep sending requests.
