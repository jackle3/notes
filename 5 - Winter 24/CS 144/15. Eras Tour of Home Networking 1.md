# Eras 0: terminals in 1970s

- Computers are connected via a series of serial lines, to devices that allow humans to send and receive reliable byte streams → **USB (universal serial bus)**
    - Serial is the realiable bytestream.
- In 1970s, each computer has several serial ports, and transmit bytes on each serial lines
    - E.g. the computer is connected to a teletype machine (tty) through a serial port
        - You type letters on one keyboard, and it appears on the paper on the other end.
            - On each side is a paper to receive information, and a keyboard to send information.
        - There is no backspace or edit what you wrote in on teletype machines

- Later teletype machines were replaced by glass terminals (or glass tty).
    
    - Glass terminals would allow editing and erasing, and you can see the whole file.

- **Connection Path:**
    - Glass terminals — serial port — computers

# Eras 0.1: Terminals + Modems

- Then, people started to want to have **glass terminals at their home**.
    
    - Anything input into the glass terminals was transmitted to a computer at a different location through **telephone lines**
    - modulator/demodulator => modem (transform between bits and telephone signals)
        - **Modulator** - connected to both ends, converts from bits to audio so it can send it through telephone lines.
        - **Demodulator** - connected to both ends, converts from audio to bits.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 2 98.png|Untitled 2 98.png]]
    
- The modems are performing **interposition** on existing service abstractions.
    - (modem — telephone lines — modem) is an interposing (x-in-the-middle)
    - The glass terminals and computers on the two sides are **not aware of these modems** and telephone lines and still consider they are directly connected to each other through a serial port.
- **Connection path:**
    - Glass terminals — serial port **— modulator/demodulator — telephone lines — modulator/demodulator —** serial port — computers

# Eras 1: Internet at Home

- Glass terminals were replaced by computers (PC) in home, and PCs were speaking TCP/IP.
- Computers were connected to routers, which connected them to internet servers.
    
    - The computer and the server had routing tables and an IP address. They were also connected to routers.

## Internet Datagrams

- We want to be able to connect directly to the server, using IP datagrams as a service.
- We can do this using **serial line to internet protocol.**
    - SLIP tags a length on each IP datagrams so that given bytesteams, SLIP can cut them into datagrams → SLIP was later replaced by **point to point protocol (PPP)**
- The computer in the middle can now be replaced by a SLIP or PPP terminator.
    - On the router, it will route all datagrams matching `18.241.5.0/24` through `18.241.5.7`, which is the IP address of the PPP terminator. The terminator will then route the packet to the computer through its `PPP0` NIC.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 4 93.png|Untitled 4 93.png]]
        
    - Alternatively, you can just put the routing table for the PPP terminal inside the router itself. The router is then responsible for sending ARP for the ethernet addresses.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 5 93.png|Untitled 5 93.png]]
        
- Using this, your computer is now on the internet. It has a routing table, that sends everything to the router. Note that the router has IP address `18.241.5.1`
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 6 92.png|Untitled 6 92.png]]
    
- **Connection path:**
    - **PC — TCP/IP — SLIP** — serial port — modem — telephone lines — modem — serial port **—** **SLIP — TCP/IP — PC**

## Limitations

- The current abstraction is still pretty slow, since it has to go through the serial lines.
- The limitation on the serial line is the data rate.
    - This is Shannon’s capacity. It’s limited by the power of the sender, the noise of the receiver, and the bandwidth of the line.
    - At the time, the maximum data rate was 56 kbit/s.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 7 89.png|Untitled 7 89.png]]
        
- To overcome this, the world moved on to better modems.
    - These modems had more bandwidth and more data rate, sending data through a cable.
    - Same cables that bring cable TV to your house → bandwidth is like 1 Ghz → broadband

# Eras 2: Cable modems

- Instead of speaking serial or SLIP/PPP, modem also speaks Ethernet.
    - The modem plugs directly into the rotuer. No longer has to pass through PPPT.
- The computer uses DHCP to get its own IP address, its own router, and its own DNS server.
    
    - Someone on the ISP’s network is the one that answers the DHCP request.

## Setting up TCP Connection

- Given level 1, if we abstract modems/computers on the path between a PC and the destination it want to talk to, it becomes this:
    - PC – TCP/IP – modem – **ISP (which is actually – modem — (PPP7) — router — other network interfaces (e.g. eth0)) – Internet** – router — remote network (reddit)
- Each part of this graph needs to keep some **states** for having a TCP connection between PC and reddit:
    - PC and reddit each needs a **TCP Socket.** Each socket remembers the src and dst addresses, aswell as the ports.
        - `bind` sets the local addr, and `connect` sets the peer
        - If you want to just listen, you only bind. You don’t connect.
    - And the routers of ISP and reddit need to know next hops for datagrams
- Recall that this is the graph of the connection right now:
    
    - The computer has an IP of `18.241.5.20`.
    - The server has an IP of `9.1.2.3`.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 9 79.png|Untitled 9 79.png]]
    
- When the **reddit server begins**, it’ll create a socket.
    
    - This socket does not know its own IP address.
    - The local address is just any address. It’s currently unconnected so the peer is not there.
    - This is essentially the result of calling `bind`.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 10 74.png|Untitled 10 74.png]]
    
- If the **PC computer** now wants to start a TCP connection, it’ll create a socket.
    
    - It will set its peer address because it only cares about who its talking to.
    - This is the result of calling `connect`.
    - Once it calls `connect`, the kernel will assign that socket a local address.
        - This local address will have some **available port number**. A port for the local IP is available if any of (local ip, peer ip, peer port) is different.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 11 72.png|Untitled 11 72.png]]
    
    - The `connect` call under TCP will send a segment to the peer, with the SYN flag set.
- The **server** will accept that segment to produce a connected socket.
    
    - This is the result of calling `accept` on the segment. This creates a new socket that is connected to the other one.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 12 71.png|Untitled 12 71.png]]
    
- Then the PC would need to keep:
    - TCP Socket:
        - Local → 18.241.5.20:1111 (src address:src port)
        - Peer → 9.1.2.3:80 (dst address:dst port)
- And reddit has:
    - TCP Socket:
        - Local → 9.1.2.3:80 (src address:src port)
        - Peer → 18.241.5.20:1111 (dst address:dst port)

# Eras 3: Home network

- So far, there is only **one device/computer on the network**.
- In this era, multiple PCs are connected to the same modem.
    - All PCs are connected to different ports of a switch and the switch is connected to the modem.
    - A switch keeps an ethernet to port mapping. (**A switch does not look at IP headers).**
- The switch essentially just extends the link layer.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 13 69.png|Untitled 13 69.png]]
    
- PC1: 18.241.5.20 and PC2: 18.241.5.21 are connected to the same switch
    - PC1 – switch – modem
    - PC2 – switch – modem
- However, this requires it so that the ISP router has to keep track of the IP address of each device in the home network.

# Eras 4: Home subnet

- Level 3 is annoying because the ISP’s routing table has an entry for both PC1 and PC2, and a “delegation” would make this easier.
    - To fix this, the ISP can just delegate a whole subnetwork to the house.
    - It delegates a range of address (e.g. `18.241.5.0/24 via eth0` to the home network)
- This is full delegation.
    - The DHCP server now belongs to the home network.
- At the home, there is a router between switch and modem:
    - PC1 – switch – (eth0) – router – (eth1) – modem – (to ISP)
    - PC2 – switch – (eth0) – router – (eth1) – modem – (to ISP)
- At the home router’s routing table:
    - 0/0: eth1 via [ISP’s IP address]
    - 18.241.5.0/24: eth0 (go into home network)
- At the ISP’s routing table:
    - 0/0: eth0 via [address of ISP’s ISP]
    - 18.1.2.0/24: eth1 via [router’s IP address]
- However, this still requires that devices plug directly into the switch.

# Eras 5: Home Wireless Network

- The home switch is extended via a Wi-Fi access point (AP).
    - Each computer now has a NIC for wireless access, `wlan`.

![[attachments/Untitled 14 65.png|Untitled 14 65.png]]

- And then it gets harder for an ISP to assign an IP address to every device connected to the Wi-Fi in every its customers’ home.
    - Instead of giving the customer a range of IP addresses, it would now give the customer just a single IP address for the whole home subnet → `18.241.5.20/32`

![[attachments/Untitled 15 63.png|Untitled 15 63.png]]

# Eras 6: Proxy server

- This is a way of multiplexing to devices, that is not a globally visible IP address.
    - The US government reserved the ranges `10.0.0.0/8` and `192.168.0.0/16` , and others, just for private use. These are used to assign a local range of IPv4 addresses.
- Each subnets have a local range of IPv4 addresses
    
    - To facilate this, there is **one computer** (the jump host/mutiplexer) that is actually on the internet.
    - Every other computer is assigned a local IPv4 address.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 16 59.png|Untitled 16 59.png]]
    
    - The modem talks to the jump host, not the switch.

## Encapsulation

- To connect a PC to the internet, we need **two connections.**
    - The first connection connects the PC to the jump host.
    - The second connection connects the jump host to the modem.

![[attachments/Untitled 17 55.png|Untitled 17 55.png]]

- The PC is on the far left. It has a single socket that is connected to the jump host.
- The jump host is in the middle. It has three sockets.
    - It has one that is just simply listening.
    - It has another that is connected to the PC.
        - This socket is linked to the third socket, reading in bytes from the PC and sending it out to the internet.
    - It has a third that is connected to the peer on the internet.
- The peer is on the far right. It has two sockets.
    - It has one that is simply listening.
    - It has one socket that is connected to the jump host.
