# Datagram

- a short piece of data (aka a “**packet**”) that includes:
    - a “destination” address with meaning in some context
        - globally identifies **one** computer
    - other data (the “payload”)

## Service Abstraction

- the network will make “best efforts” to deliver the datagram to its destination
    - the network is responsible for finding a way to get it to the destination address
- no matter where the datagram is currently!
    - the “destination” address is sufficient to find the ultimate destination. It’s not just the “next hop” – it’s the final destination of that datagram.
    - Any part of the network knows how to deal with it to get it closer to its final destination.
- ByteStreams are also examples of service abstraction

## Possible scenarios when sending

- Some things that can happen with “best effort” delivery are
    - Delievered once and no one else gets a copy
    - Delievered multiple times
    - Never delivered
    - Delivered wrong (modified payload or truncated)
    - Delivered after a very long time
    - Delivered late (after another datagram sent later)
    - Delivered to another place
    - Intercepted (somebody else could get it with or without getting delivered)
- Basically, sending a datagram is **not reliable**

## Internet Datagram

- There is a very specific format for internet datagrams based on the Internet Protocol

```C++
\#include "socket.hh"

using namespace std;

struct RawSocket : public DatagramSocket
{
	RawSocket() : DatagramSocket( AF_INET, SOCK_RAM, IPPRQTQ_RAW ) {}
};

int main() {
	// construct an Internet Datagram
  string datagram;
	
	datagram += 0x45; // internet version 4, and headerlength of 5
	datagram += string( 7, 0 ); // 7 bytes of information you don't care abt
	datagram += 64; // time to live (units are number of hops)
	datagram += string( 7, 0 ); // 7 more bytes of don't care
	
	// 4 bytes of destination address
	// this is the public Internet Protocol address (IPv4)
	datagram += 13;
	datagram += 126;
	datagram += 170;
	datagram += 139;

	// add the payload
	datagram += "Hello world OR tomorrow. LOGIN.";

	// send the message through the socket
	// notice that we just send it to a random address
	RawSocket{}.sendto( Address{ " 1 " }, datagram );

	return 0;
}
```

- Every hop, it decrements the TTL. If the TTL ever gets to zero, the packet just gets ignored.

# Encapsulation

- The property of assigning an object to be the payload of another object, where the outer object is oblivious to the meaning or contents of its payload
    - Each packet does not know what is in the payload
- Looking at the payload is **decapsulating** the datagram
- A payload can have other payloads inside of it
    - Each person is looking at its own payload in a payload of payload of payload, but only the payload at its level, nothing further
- The **payload can have its own format**
    - For example, an email can be the payload, and emails have their own formats

## Examples

- The postal service will carry a package you give it [within certain externally visible specifications, e.g. weight and dimensions], without looking inside the contents. The package is opened, and the contents have meaning and are viewed **only by the recipient.**
- A cargo ship will carry any container you give it, without looking inside the contents [with certain limits. The container is **only opened by the recipient.**
- The Internet will carry any datagram you give it [within certain externally visible specifications, e.g. length], without looking inside the payload. The payload of an Internet datagram has meaning **only to the endpoints.**

# Multiplexing (muxing)

- Sharing a resource by using a multiplexing key to make control decisions
    - For a letter, the address is the multiplexing key → tells us where letter goes
    - For a datagram, the destination address is the key → tells us where datagram goes

## Encapsulating with multiplexing

- You can have multiplexing on multiple levels (combining encapsulation and multiplexing)
    
    ![Untitled 1 94.png](../../attachments/Untitled%201%2094.png)
    
    - Suppose the above were a datagram, where the payload is an email.
    - We have multiplexing on the top level (to: computer) → key to tell the network what computer to deliver the payload to.
    - We have multiplexing on the inner level (to: email@gmail.com)→ key to tell program on computer what mailbox to deliver message to.

## Communicating with processes

- You can use encapsulation to talk to processes within the computer as well, sending payload from one process to another.
    
    ![Untitled 2 94.png](../../attachments/Untitled%202%2094.png)
    
    - The outer message (to: computer) is interpreted by the internet.
        - This is called an **internet datagram.** You’re speaking the **Internet Protocol (IP)**
    - The inner message (to: process x) is interpreted by the kernel, a privileged part of computer.
        - This is called a **user datagram.** You’re speaking the **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**
    - The innermost message (payload) is only being looked at by process x.
- If you want to communicate to multiple processes, you would need to send multiple internet datagrams

## Examples

- the IP address allows different endpoints to share a single communications link. Each router hands off the datagram to a different next hop _**based on the contents of this field**_.
- The “protocol field” of the Internet datagram allows different encapsulated protocols to share the resource of host-to-host Internet datagrams. The kernel hands off the datagram payload to a different internal kernel program (e.g. ping, UDP) _**based on the contents of this field.**_
- The “destination port number” field of the user datagram allows different processes/programs to share the resource of host-to-host Internet datagrams. The UDP program hands off the payload to a different user program (e.g. Chrome, traceroute) _**based on the contents of this field.**_
