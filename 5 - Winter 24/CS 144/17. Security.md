# Checksum

- **IP Checksum** - detects accidental changes in the datagram’s header.
	- It can’t really detect intentional corruption, since bad actors can also just update the checksum.
	- Changes in the payload also can’t be covered by the IP checksum.
- **TCP Checksum** - detects accidental changes in the header **and** the payload.
	- TCP checksum is calculated over the entire TCP segment, including the TCP header and the data, as well as a pseudo-header that includes certain fields from the IP header.
- **UDP Checksum** - detects changes in the header **and** the payload.
	- Similar to TCP, but the checksum field is optional.
- Usually calculated by summing up all the considered fields in the header and/or the payload.
	- The checksum should make it so that the sum equals zero.
	- In some cases, checksum is often stored as the ones' complement of the sum of the other fields.
		- Adding a number to its ones' complement results in all ones (i.e., the complement of zero).

# Cryptography

- **Internet Protocol** does not provide:
	- Integrity → IP does not guarantee that a bad actor can’t alter the contents.

				- For example, if someone modifies the payload of TCP and also updates the checksum, it will still be a valid datagram This is a violation of integrity.

		- Confidentiality → IP does not prevent the datagram from being eavesdropped.
	- Authenticity → IP does not ensure that the receiver is who you think they are.
- The technology that provides these are called **cryptography**. The ability to keep secrets in information.
	- These were not included because **it was too hard and expensive** to provide these.
	- It was also heavily regulated by the government.
	- The internet was basically funded by the military, who would not have approved of including cryptography in public versions of the internet

# TLS/SSL

- The issue with the checksum is that it’s **too easy to modify**. Bad actors can easily recalculate it once they change a field.
	- It’s also very easy to change the payload in a way that preserves the checksum.
	- Checksum is simply the sum of the fields, so if we just change it in a way that the sum is the same, we are good.
- We can add another layer encapsulated within TCP, which is called the transport layer security or secure socket layer.

- Instead of using the checksum, they use a **secure hash** to verify the integrity of the packet.
	- Any change in the input of the hashing algorithm produces a huge change in the output.
- As of now:
	- There is no way to reverse engineer, given the output, what the input was.
	- Given a particular output, there is no known way to produce two different inputs that has to the same secure hash.
		- No known way to change payload and keep same secure hash value.

![Untitled 2 96.png](attachments/Untitled%202%2096.png)

- If you and the receiver **agree on the hash**, no one can change the file being sent without the hash changing.
	- How do we get that agreement though?

# How Do We Get Hash Agreements?

- **Out-of-band**: meet with the receiver in real life, tell them the hash, and then eventually send the documents.
- **Trust-on-first-use (TOFU)**: give receiver the hash, then maybe like 5 years later, send them the message. That message matches the first hash you gave them.
	- This is like when you ssh into a computer for the first time, and it asks: you’ve never SSH’ed into this computer before. do you accept that this is their public key?

## AEAD Cipher

- **Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)** a way to protect the integrity in a confidential way.
	- The method to calculate the secure hash (e.g. SHA256) is public information, so it’s hard to get the hash to the receiver.
	- We want some way to send a single packet where the bad guy can’t alter the plaintext then alter the hash to match it.
- The inputs of the cipher are a key, a plaintext, and a number that only be used once.
	`enc(key, plaintext, nonce)` → `<ciphertext, tag>`
	`dec(key, ciphertext, tag, nonce)` → `optional<plaintext>`

- Instead of using the secure hash, we can use a tag. This tag is only manufacturable by **someone who has the key**. It can also only be decrypted by someone who has the key.
	- The receiver and the sender just need to **agree on a key**. They can then make messages and no bad guys can modify it without them knowing.
- The advantage over the secure hash is:
	- SHA256 can only be used to protect one message.
	- The key can be used to protect a whole series of messages, each one with their own `nonce`. The purpose of the `nonce` is that the ciphertext is **different** even if the message is the same.
	- This also **provides confidentiality**.
	- You can make the payload of the message the encrypted ciphertext.
	- You can include the `nonce` and the `tag` as plaintext in the message.
	- The key is already agreed upon beforehand.
	- The receiver is only one who can properly decipher the message.

	- This also **provides authenticity**, as long as we know that the only person who has the key is the receiver.
- **We still have the issue of exchanging the key between sender and receiver.**
		- This type of cryptography is called symmetric or shared-key cryptography. We still share the key using TOFU or out-of-band, but it works. This was good enough for the military to use.

# Stack

- This is what our stack looks like right now. We’ve inserted the TLS layer in between HTTP and TCP.
		- The TLS layer transforms one bytestream into another bytestream.
				- Takes in plaintext stream from HTTP and produces a ciphertext stream for TCP.
				- Takes in ciphertext stream from TCP and produces plaintext stream for HTTP.
		- Nothing else in the stack has changed. The TLS layer is an **interposer** or man-in-the-middle.

# How to exchange Key without Meeting?

- If we don’t have the ability to meet together, how do we agree on a shared key between sender and receiver?
- **Trusted third party**: if we have a chain of people who have met using TOFU or out-of-band, and they are trusted, we can use that to exchange the key to someone we haven’t met.
		- This is how shared-key cryptography works in real life in the military.

## Asymmetric / Public-key Cryptography

- A way to communicate in a way that is eavesdropped upon by everybody, while still agreeing on a shared secret key that is only known to the sender and the receiver.
- We generate a **pair of numbers** that are linked, for both the sender and the receiver.
		- E.g. `keith_public` and `keith_private` , and `donovan_public` and `donovan_private`
		- We keep the private keys private, but the public key is known to everyone.
- **Authenticated Key Exchange (Ache):** Suppose there is some function.

		- Keith can give `donovan_public` (which he knows) and `keith_private` and a `nonce` as input. This will produce him some secret key.
		- Donovan can give `keith_public` and `donovan_private` and the **same** `nonce` as input, and it will produce him **the same secret key.**

		![Untitled 6 90.png](attachments/Untitled%206%2090.png)

		- The private key never gets sent.
- From here, they can both use the secret key and communicate with AEAD and symmetric/shared-key crytography.
- The issue here is **authenticity**: how do we know that this public key belongs to the real Donovan?
		- One example is **TOFU**: The first time you ssh to a computer, it asks you “Do you wish to accept _this_ is the public key of this computer?”
				- The first time you connect, it asks you to TOFU the server.
				- Once you accept, it saves that public key on your computer.

## Authenticity

- Asking directly for the public key does not work, since that message may be corrupted.
- For a small number of entities, we could store a directory of public keys that were shared in a 100% secure way (e.g. an in-person meeting). We can use those entities to verify.

## Certificate

- They can have a function called `sign` that produces a signature, and `verify`
		- `sign(private_key, msg)` produces a `signature`
		- `verify(public_key, msg, signature)` produces a `bool` whether its good or not
- e.g. You are asking Keith for Donovan’s public key, and you know Keith’s public key.
		- Keith will create a certificate with his signature on it.
				- `sign(privateKeith, “Donovan's public key is <x> according to Keith (expiring at time t)”)` → `signatureKeith`
		- You can run verify on that certificate and signature.
				- `verify(publicKeith, “Donovan's public key is <x> according to Keith (expiring at time t)”, signatureKeith)` → `true`.
				- Then, this is a “certificate” that Keith verifies Donovan’s public key is <x>.
						- The certificate is `<publicDonovan, msg, signatureKeith>`
						- You basically give them: here’s my public key, here’s a message from someone you trust, and here’s a signature from someone you trust.
		- **Donovan can store this certificate**, and show this to any person that trusts Keith to prove that Donovan is actually Donovan.
		- Keith is a **certification authority (CA)**.
