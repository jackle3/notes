# Four-layer Internet Model

- The application layer is the user program itself.
- The transport layer is TCP.
- The network layer is like IP.
- Link is the lowest layer of the stack. It’s the physical layer.

# Link Layer

- The abstraction provided by the link layer is the transmission of bits across links.
    - For instance, it tells us that the time to send stuff across the link is defiend by the serialization delay and the propagation delay.
- Suppose we want to send the number `176` through the link.

- We would send the binary representation.

## On-off keying

- This is one way we could send it through the link. When there is a `1`, we send volts (a signal) throught the link. When there is a `0`, we don’t send a signal.

- The issue is that this requires there to be a static interval for each bit. If the interval length ever changes, or we don’t keep track of it correctly, our message is messed up.
    - If the clock speeds are not perfect, on-off keying can fail on repeated bits.
- For instance, if the message was 1000 bytes of zeros, there is a highly likely chance that the link layer may mistake this as 999 bytes or 1001 bytes of zeros, since there is no change in signal.
- This is a **violation of encapsulation**
    - Depending on the input, the link layer may mess up the message.

## Binary phase-shift keying

- This ensures that any values of bytes can be carried successfully over the link, with equal probability of being messed up.
- It requires that there is a transition (from up to down) at least once every interval
    - This allows the receiver to always know what the interval size (clock speed) of the sender is.
- When the signal goes up in the middle of the interval, that means that location is a one.
- When the signal goes down, that means that bit is a zero.

- This is another example of this. Notice that we made sure there was at least one transition in every interval.

- If there is 500 `1`s in a row, it is very easy to see what it is based on the signal since we know what each interval is.

# Maximum data rate

- What determines the maximum speed of bits you can send over a cable, fiber, etc?
    - The links below is known as the **single input single output** channel.

- Here are a few limitation factors if you wanted to send from `sender` to `receiver` through the `channel`
    - What signals are permissible through the channel?
        - You can’t send too high or too low of a frequency → the higher the frequency, the more signals you can send.
        - **Band** of the channel is the chunk between the lowest and highest frequency
        - The **bandwidth** is the width between the lowest and the highest frequency signal
    - How much power do you have at the sender?
        - The more power, the more you can send. This is like yelling louder.
    - How much noise is at the receiver?
        - This would be like how loud it is where the receiver is at → how hard is it to hear the sender?
        - This is called white gaussian noise. This gets added to whatever the signal (sender) power is.
        - `AWGN` stands for added white gaussian noise.

# Shannon capacity

- This defines the capacity of the channel.
    - $B$﻿ is the bandwidth → the permissible signals thru the channel.
    - $S$﻿ is the signal power → the amount of power at the sender.
    - $N$﻿ is the nosie → the amount of noise power at the receiver.
- The output of the formula is in `bits per second`

## The Capacity

- For a **single input single output** channel, if your data rate is **below the capacity**, you can send data with an arbitrarily small error.
    - If your data rate exceeds the capacity, the error rate is equal to the difference between the data rate and the capacity.
