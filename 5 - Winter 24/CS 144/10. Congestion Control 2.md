# Simple method - receiver forces one packet

- One easy way without any major changes is to just make it so that the sender can only send one packet at a time. This can be enforced by the receiver.
- Suppose that the maximum packet size was 1500 bytes. If the receiver keeps reporting a window size of 1500 bytes, the sender can only send one packet per round-trip.

- The throughput of the example above is
    - `1500 bytes per 100 ms` = `15000 bytes per second` = `120000 bits per second`
- There is a correlation between the window size and the throughput.
    - If window size is `1500 bytes`, the throughput is `15 kbytes per second` on this lnk
    - If window size is `3000 bytes`, the throughput is `30 kbytes per second` on this link
- This correlation is capped at the data rate of the link.
    - If window size is `100 terabytes`, the throughput is `5 Mbit/s = 625 kbytes/s`
    - However, with this window, there will also be a **huge queuing delay.**

# Better method - second congestion window

- This method is the same as the above. However, instead of just advertising that window size, we now make the sender respect **two** windows, and choose the second window size smartly.

- The effective window that the sender uses will be the minimum of the congestion window and the receiver’s window.

## Bandwidth-Delay Product

![Untitled 3 91.png](../../attachments/Untitled%203%2091.png)

- The maximum number of sequence numbers that can be "outstanding" (in flight) at the same time without any queueing delay
    - BDP is the maximum amount of data that can be in transit on the network / link at a time.
- Equation is `BDP = data rate * RTT`
    - Product of the link's data rate (in bits per second) and the round-trip time in seconds.
- If we had a 160 Mbit/s link and an RTT of 950ms:
    - `BPD = (160 Mbit/s) * 0.95 s = 152 Mbits = 19 megabytes`

## Best congestion window size

- The BDP is the ideal window size for that flow → maximum number of bytes that the sender should send per trip, without having anything in queue.
- A “no loss” window is the maximum window size where no packets are dropped.

![Untitled 4 87.png](../../attachments/Untitled%204%2087.png)

- If we consider the scenario from before, where the RTT is 100ms and r = 625 kbyte/s
    
    ![Untitled 5 87.png](../../attachments/Untitled%205%2087.png)
    
    - `BDP = 625 kbytes/s * 100ms = 62.5 kbytes = 62500 bytes` is the ideal window size.
        - This window size maximizes the throughput, while ensuring there is no queuing delay.
        - The win size of 3000 does not maximize throughput.
        - The win size of infinity maximizes throughput, but introduces a lot of queueing delay.

# Self-clocking

![Untitled 7 83.png](../../attachments/Untitled%207%2083.png)

- The main idea is that:
    - Once the window is full, the sender won’t send any new data until an acknowledgement comes in.
    - If it does send data, it’ll only be a small chunk at the edge of the window.
        - In this case, it sends a single segment at the edge of the window.
- We cap the window size instead of the **rate** because it is more resistant to error.
    - If the actual congestion window is 3000, but the sender believes it’s 3500, the worst case is that 500 bytes will be dropped or be in the queue. However, the queue won’t get full.
    - If we send with the wrong rate, the queue will continuously grow until its full.
- With self-clocking in place, the queueing delay of each segment is almost zero.

## Example

- Suppose we are using the same network as before, and the window starts out at 62.5 kbytes.
    
    - At this point, the sender will try to fill up the whole window, sending multiple segments.
    
    ![Untitled 8 77.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2077.png)
    
- After 100ms (RTT), sender will receive acknowledgement for the first segment that it sent.
    
    - Only the first segment because this is the only one that has reached the receiver, since segments have to pass through the router and queue.
    - The new window after it receives the ackno will be `ackno + 1500`, showing that the first segment (which has size `1500`) was received.
    
    ![Untitled 9 73.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2073.png)
    
    - Everything except the last 1500 bytes of this new window will be full, since the sender already sent it previously.
- 2.4ms after the first ack received (serialization delay of segment), sender will receive another acnowledgement for the next segment.
    
    - Basically, it’ll receive the ack for the next segment at `RTT + serialization delay = 100ms + (1500 bytes / 5 Mbits per second) = 100ms + 2.4ms = 102.4ms`
    - Similar to before, the whole window except the last 1500 bytes will be full.

# Approximating right congestion window

- The values necessary to find the ideal congestion window are unknown at runtime!
    
    ![Untitled 11 67.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%2067.png)
    
- The general strategy is to increase congestion window size on success, decrease on loss
    - The goal is to find the ideal congestion window size, which we found earlier to be equal to BDP divided by the number of flows.

## AIMD: Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease

![Untitled 12 66.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%2066.png)

- On success, increase window size by 1 segment.
- On loss, halve the window size.

![Untitled 13 64.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%2064.png)

- Start with a small congestion window size

![Untitled 14 60.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2014%2060.png)

- Then, increase the window size on success
    - Success occurs when the segment was fully acknowledged
- **The increase on success is only 1 segment** **per RTT**.
    - `cwnd = cwnd + (segment size) / cwnd`
- The growth is linear. We grow by one segment per RTT.
    - After the full flight segment is acknowledged, we would increase by one.

![Untitled 15 58.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2015%2058.png)

- Then, decrease the window size on loss.
    - Loss occurs generally when the timeout is triggered, meaning that:
        - Segment sent long ago is not acknowledged
        - Later segments are acknowledged while earlier has not
- We know that later segments are acknowledged while earlier has not if we receive duplicate acknowledgement numbers.
    
    - Three later segments arrived, but since it’s missing a middle ackno it’s sending a duplicate. This indicates that `2000...2999` is likely lost.
    
    ![Untitled 16 55.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2016%2055.png)
    
    - This method of finding out is called “fast retransmission”
- When a packet is lost, we assume that it’s lost because of congestion.
    - Congestion occurs when we overflow the router queue and packets start to drop.
    - The big decrease is because we want to make sure we’re no longer filling up the queue.
        - It also allows other flows to enter and use the link. If we’re sending so much that we’re overflowing the queue, no other flow is able to use the link.

## Slow-start: exponential growth at the beginning

- Everytime we get a successful ackno, increase `cwnd` by the number of bytes acknowledged.
    - Sender starts at a slow rate (hence the name), but increases exponentially until the first loss.

![Untitled 17 52.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2017%2052.png)

- This is now exponential growth.
    - For every acknowledge seqno, the window grows by one seqno.
    - If the window is two, and you send out two seqnos and receive acknowledgement for those two, the **window is now four**.
    - If the window is four, and you send out four seqnos and receive acknowledgement for those four, the **window is now eight**.
- The full segment does not have to be acknowledged before we can grow significantly. We increase based on **bytes** acknowledged now.

# Ideal value of router’s buffer

- What is the maximum size that the queue can grow to, before it starts dropping packets?
- The ideal value of the buffer should:
    1. Ensure that the link is fully utilized
    2. The round-trip-time for a `ping` is as small as possible.

![Untitled 18 50.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2018%2050.png)

## Locations that an outstanding byte can be

1. On the link from sender to receiver, or at the receiver and ack is in flight.
    1. In this case, the maximum number of bytes that can be in this situation is the BDP.
2. In the output queue at the router / bottleneck.
    1. Below is what the congestion window looks like from the sender’s POV
        
        ![Untitled 19 46.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2019%2046.png)
        
        - The window will continously grow and shrink once it hits the limit.
        - The value of the limit (e.g. the maximum cwnd size) is equal to `BDP + buffer size`. This is because once it exceeds this, bytes start getting dropped from the buffer.
    2. Below is what the queue occupancy looks like from the router’s POV
        
        ![Untitled 20 45.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2020%2045.png)
        
        - The graph from before was (1) + (2), the bytes on the link plus the bytes in the queue.
        - This graph now just has (2), the bytes in the queue.
        - Our goal is to have the occupancy just barely touch zero at its lowest. If it’s at zero for a long time, that means no bytes are being sent.

## Ideal buffer size

- Look at the two graphs above. We want a buffer size such that when the sender halves the cwnd size, the queue occupancy minimum is just zero.
    - This means that when the window size halves, all the bytes should be on the link in (1), and not in the buffer at (2).
- To achieve this, the maximum buffer size should also be BDP.
    - We want `cwnd / 2 - BDP = 0`
    - This means `(BDP + buffer) / 2 - BDP = 0`
    - This means `BDP + buffer - 2 * BDP = 0`
    - This means `buffer = BDP`
