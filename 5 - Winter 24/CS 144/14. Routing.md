# Routing Table

- The table tells computers where to send packets to their intended destination.
    - It does so by prefix-matching, finding the longest-prefix-match route.

# General Approaches to sending packets

## Flooding

- Flooding can be thought of as simply sending it out as much at possible.
    - Every router will send packets to every link that its connected to.

## Source Routing

- The source knows where the destination is, so it sends it telling the others to follow that path.
    - The source router is F, the destination is B.
    - From F, it tells the path (DEB).
    - At every hop, it removes one from the front.

## Distributed Algorithms

- Each node makes a decision based on knowledge of its topology → uses routing algorithms to find shortest path, or best path.

### Bellman-Ford

- Able to handle negative weights, as well as negative cycles.

- Essentially continously propagates outwards based on neighboring nodes.
- Does not reveal the full topology because each router only the path to its neighboring nodes.
    - We know the cost to get to a non-neighboring node, but not the path.
- Below is an example. Each row represents a step, and we are propagating from F.
    - In the first step (row), everyone is set to infinity.
    - In the second step, F is connected to E and D, so update their costs.
    - For the third step, notice that the cost for E is updated. This is because you can get a cheaper path to E by passing through E.
- Each row $k$﻿ essentially represents the cheapest cost path using at most $k-1$﻿ edges.

## Dijkstra’s

- For this, each router has to know the full topology.

![[attachments/Untitled 6 89.png|Untitled 6 89.png]]

- Finds the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes.
- Below is an example.
    - In the first step, the candidates from B are A and E. Since the cost to E is lower than the cost to A, we add E.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 7 86.png|Untitled 7 86.png]]
        
    - In you’re starting at A, once you’ve ran Dijkstra, you should know:
        - The cost to get to all other nodes.
        - The shortest path to get to all other nodes.
            - Should know the next hop that it should take, given the destination. It reasons about this based on the shortest path that it remembered.

# Routing Protocols

- These are **dynamic** routing protocols. When there are changes in the network, you don’t have to explicitly define where the routes are going to.
- We have Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) and Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)

- Distance vector sends the entire routing table. Link state only shared information, such as about the topology.

## Distance Vector: RIP

![[attachments/Untitled 9 76.png|Untitled 9 76.png]]

- Since its dynamic, RIP can work when there are changes in the network, such as when a link is cut.
- The table is the cost to get to R3.
    
    - `R1` knows its a cost of two, and it passes through `R2`
    - `R2` knows its a cost of one, since its direct.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 10 72.png|Untitled 10 72.png]]
    
- When a link gets cut, this effectively creates a positive cycle. The cost will continue increasing to infinity.

## Link-State: OSPF

- Each router node will tell its neighbors of the surrounding topology. It only updates when there is a change in the topology.
    - If router A is connected to router B and router C, then router A will tell router B that its also connected to router C, and vice versa.
    - This sharing is propagated outwards, and eventually each node knows the full topology.

## RIP vs OSPF

- Bellman Ford is slower than Dijkstra’s.
    - For RIP, the metrix is hop count. If I am one hop away, then the cost is just one. If I am two hops away, then the cost is two.
    - For OSPF, the link rate is the metric. It essentially measures how long it takes data to be sent.

- Both of these are somewhat practical for small networks. However, it’s not practical for the internet, where there are billions of destination addresses.
    - There isn’t a reasonable data structure that we can use to store all of these.

# Autonomous Systems

- Divide up space of IP addresses into some hierarchical fasion.
    - The responsibility of getting to the right network belongs to one system.
    - The responsibility of routing within each network belongs to another system.
- For instance, we can say that `171.64.0.0/14` is Stanford’s range of IP addresses.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 14 63.png|Untitled 14 63.png]]
    
    - Stanford is responsible for routing destination addreses that match that prefix.
    - A different system is responsible for getting packets to Stanford, knowing that it falls within that range. From there, Stanford will route it.
- MIT would have `18.0.0.0/11` as its range. This means that MIT has more IP addresses than Stanford, since it matches a shorter prefix.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 15 61.png|Untitled 15 61.png]]
    
- If an organization has the range `76.76.21.0/24`, they own 256 IP addresses. The first 24 bits match, and the last 8 bits are free.

## Border Gateway Protocol

- The routers within the network keep track of its own IP addresses, and is responsible for routing within the network.
- The routers at the borders of networks keep track of other autonomous sytems.
    
    - Once it gets to MIT’s border gateway/router, that router is responsible for routing it within MIT’s network.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 16 57.png|Untitled 16 57.png]]
    
- If we kept track of every IP address, we would need to keep track of $2^{32}$﻿ addresses.
    - In comparison there are very few autonomous sytems/networks (on the order of 100k)

# Internet Service Provider

- There isn’t a physical connection between Stanford’s border router and MIT’s border router.
- Stanford pays an ISP to get a route to the internet.
    - Stanford’s border router will connect to the ISP’s border router.
    - Stanford’s routing table will say:
        - `171.64.0.0/14` goes inside the network, so Stanford can route it.
        - `0.0.0.0/0` goes to the ISP, to be sent outwards through the ISP.
- The ISP can be connected to other ISPs.

![[attachments/Untitled 17 53.png|Untitled 17 53.png]]

- **Transit:** paying an ISP to get a default route, that allows them to connect to the internet and send stuff anywhere else.
- **Peering:** skipping past the ISP and making a direct connection between two autonomous systems.

# Net Neutrality

![[attachments/Untitled 18 51.png|Untitled 18 51.png]]

- If Xfinity is one of the people on the routes, it could theoretically look at the source address and slow down packets coming from a specific network.
    - Xfinity could ask Netflix for money, in exchang for not slowing down its packets to its customers.
- Net neutrality aims to prevent this.
