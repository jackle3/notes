# IP Addresses

- The domain names that we generally use are mapped to IP addresses. We can find the address of a domain using `host`, which is implemented with UDP

## Simple Implementation of DNS server

- The DNS server is implemented basically like how the reliable Q&A is implemented.
    - The terminal sends DNS a datagram to query for a domain
    - It waits 1 seconds
    - If a reply datagram is given from the DNS server, return the IP address
        - Else, if count > 10, return failure
        - Else count += 1, go send another query datagram

## Host Multiplexing

- Multiple domain names can have the exact same IP address.

- To tell the server which domain you’re trying to connect to, you would give the IP address as well as the `Host:` name

![Untitled 2 87.png](attachments/Untitled%202%2087.png)

- You need to provide the `Host:` field because when we run `telnet`, it first replaces the domain that’s being asked for with the IP address corresponding to the domain.
    - This is because the connection over the internet uses internet datagrams, so we must communicate with the IP address. Once you get to that IP address, it would read the `Host:` and figure out the actual name to get to.
    - Running `telnet` `[lamp.mit.edu](http://lamp.mit.edu)` `http` actually sends out `telnet 18.4.86.46 80`. It replaces the domain with IP address to send out in the datagram, and `http` is port 80
- The `Host:` header/field is a **multiplexing key**

## Address

- IP addresses in IPv4 are 32-bit numbers. Each number in the IP address, such as `18.4.86.46`, represent one byte of the 32-bit number. There are 4 bytes in 32 bits, so 4 numbers for each byte.
    - The whole IP address is a number in base 256.
- You can also refer to the IP addresses with the full 32-bit number.
    
    $18.4.84.46 = 46 + 84 * 256 + 4 * 256^2 + 18 * 256^3 = 302274094$

# DHCP

- This is how the computer knows what its own IP address is.
- When it first connects to the internet, it will send out an IP datagram. That encapsulates a UDP datagram. Inside that UDP is a DHCP datagram, requesting to find out its own IP address.

    - DHCP tells the host (the computer) how to configure itself. It tells it the 32-bit IP address, and also an address for the DNS (which the host can then use to ask abt the domain).
- This IP datagram that the host sends is
    - sent from IP 0.0.0.0 (because it does not yet know its own IP)
    - sent to IP 255.255.255.255 (which is a catch-all for sending to everyone)
    - The reply that it got was from a random address, representing the person/computer running the network that you joined.

# Reliability

![Untitled 7 79.png](attachments/Untitled%207%2079.png)

## Reliable retrieve of a short piece of data

- This is what we’ve discussed before. The UDP can be made reliable through idempotent operations and/or read-only operations.

## Reliable action

- Suppose we wanted to ensure that if we sent “Fire a torpedo” to a server, only one torpedo gets fired.
    - In order to prevent more than one fired (e.g. delivered more than once), make the instruction **idempotent.**
        - To make it idempotent, assume the torpedos have unique identifiers. You can then say “Fire torpedo \#7”, which will fire if it’s still there and won’t fire if it’s not there.

# Reliable byte stream (TCP)

- This is TCP. It’s a module that will be built on top of user datagrams.

![Untitled 8 74.png](attachments/Untitled%208%2074.png)

- As before, we need to make sure that our instructions are idempotent.
    - This is like the reassembler insert, where every letter in the byte stream is assigned an identifier, and every letter is only pushed once.
    - For example, if our byte stream had “Hello world”, idempotent operations for sending this byte stream would be:
        - starting at index 0, bytes are “Hello “
        - starting at index 6, bytes are “world” ; this is the last substring
        - starting at index 11, bytes are “” ; this is the last substring
    - The operations above will still work even if delivered in the wrong order. Each message is idempotent, and the entire set of messages is commutative (order does not matter)

## Reply from receiver

- It’s possible that certain bytes or chunks of the bytestream are never delivered or delivered to the wrong place.
- To ensure reliability, the receiver should also send acknowledgement messages back.
    - This is basically like asking the sender to send those bytes again. It also lets the sender know what bytes to _not_ send (such as when it might exceed the capacity)

## Example

- Look at 1:05:00 of [CS144 Lecture 4 on 1/22/2024 (Mon)](https://stanford-pilot.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=025d4d74-7e3a-4c6a-ad70-b0de0002a450) for live example.
- Below is what the sender sends. It sends bytes of data, and tells us what index it should go at. It also sends a FIN byte, which is **one byte after** the end of the message.

![Untitled 9 70.png](attachments/Untitled%209%2070.png)

- Our bytestream has a capcity of 8 bytes.
- After the `"" @ 0` is send, it will reply with `ack: idx 0, size 8`.
    - This means that the receiver is currently interested in the byte at index 0, and the receiver has an internal storage of 8 bytes left unpushed.
- After the `"rocks!" @ 6`, it will still reply with `ack: idx 0, size 8` and it will store the byte at the index 6.
    - The internal byte stream is `______ro`, with 8 bytes total. Notice that some data is truncated.
- After the `"CS144 " @ 0`, it will reply with `ack: idx 8, size 0` since the bytestream is now full with a contiguous piece of data from the front.
    - The internal byte stream is `CS144 ro`, and the whole chunk is pushed but not read.
- Suppose now somebody pops the first 6 bytes of the stream. The receiver will reply with `ack: idx 8, size 6` since now it has space.
    - The internal byte stream is `CS144 |ro______`, where the data before the `|` is data that has already been popped, and the data after is data that is pushed or in storage.
- After the `"cks!!!" @ 8`, it will reply with `ack: idx 14, size 0` since the stream is full.
    - The internal byte stream is `CS144 |rocks!!!`, and it’s at full capacity.
- Now suppose somebody pops the entire bytestream. It will reply `ack: idx 14, size 8`, indicating that it is empty again.
    - The internal byte stream is `CS144 rocks!!!|________`. All the data has been popped, and the bytestream is empty.
- After the `"!!!!" @ 14`, it will reply with `ack: idx 18, size 4`.
    - The internal byte stream is `CS144 rocks!!!|!!!!____`.
- After the final message `"" + FIN @ 18`, it will reply with `ack: idx 19, size ~`.
    - The size that it sends back does not matter because we know this message is the end of the byte stream.
    - The internal byte stream is now `CS144 rocks!!!|!!!!F___` where the `F` is the `FIN`.
- Once the receiver sends `ack` with `idx 19`(which is one more than the index of the last byte in the original message) that is basically the `FIN` signal. It tells the sender that it received the `FIN` message.
