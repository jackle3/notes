# Store-and-forward

- If a router is considered “store-and-forward”, this just means it waits until it has received an entire packet before it begins resending it through the next link.

# Example

- Consider a network where a Sender S is connected via a Link L1 to a Router A. Router A is connected via a Link L2 to Receiver R.
    - Assume Router A is "store-and-forward," meaning it waits until it has received an entire packet before it begins resending it.
    - The propagation rate through L1 and L2 is 200 million meters per second (2e8 m/s)
    - The data rate of L1 is 1 Mbit/s (1 million bits per second).  
        The distance of L1 is 5,000 kilometers.  
        
    - The data rate of L2 is 100 kbit/s (100,000 bits per second).  
        The distance of L2 is 10,000 kilometers.  
        
    - At time t=0 milliseconds, Sender S begins sending a packet of length 10 kbits (10,000 bits) to Receiver R. The packet will take two "hops" (one over Link L1 and one over Link L2).

- The packet **begins** arriving at Router A over Link L1 at **25ms** (propagation)
- Sender S **finishes** sending the packet over Link L1 at **10ms** (serialization)
- The packet **finishes** arriving at Router A over Link L1 at **35ms** (total time)
- Router A **begins** sending the packet to Receiver R over Link L2 after **35ms**
    - It begins sending it once it has fully received the packet.
- The packet **begins** arriving at Receiver R over Link L2 at **85ms** (propagation)
- Router A **finishes** sending the packet over Link L2 at **135ms** (serialization)
    - Takes **100ms** to serialize thic packet to link L2
- The packet **finishes** arriving at Receiver R over Link L2 at **185ms** (end-to-end)

## Sending more than one packet

- Suppose we have the same scenario, but we now send more than one packet over the different speeds.

![Untitled 1 86.png](../../attachments/Untitled%201%2086.png)

- Once the packet arrives at the router A it can’t instantly start sending it. It has to wait for $L2$﻿ to be free first before it can send it.
- The **end-to-end delay** of the first packet is → ser is serialization, prop is propagation
    - 10 (ser on L1) + 25 (prop on L1) + 100 (ser on L2) + 50 (prop on L2) = 185 ms.
- The **end-to-end delay** of the second packet is
    - 10 (ser on L1) + 25 (prop on L1) + 100 (ser on L2) + 50 (prop on L2) = 185ms.
    - Notice that this does not add up to 285ms. This is because there was the additional delay, where it was waiting at router A for L2 to be free.
- The actual end-to-end delay for the second packet is
    - 10 (queueing delay before L1) + 10 (ser on L1) + 25 (prop on L1) + 90ms (queueing delay before L2) + 100 (ser on L2) + 50 (prop on L2) = 285ms.

# Queueing Delay

![Untitled 3 86.png](../../attachments/Untitled%203%2086.png)

- We have to take into account the queueing delay on the router.
    
    ![Untitled 4 82.png](../../attachments/Untitled%204%2082.png)
    
- Note that the queue is out the outbound link.
    
    ![Untitled 5 82.png](../../attachments/Untitled%205%2082.png)
    
    - In the case above, there are two senders going into router A. The queue is on the outbound from router A to router R.
    - Packets coming in go to the back of the queue. The front of the queue gets sent out.
    - In this specific example, the rate of $A(t)$﻿ equals the rate of $D(t)$﻿.
        - If it were **cut-throug**h, there is basically no queueing delay, because the input rate is the same as the output rate.
        - If it were **store-and-forward**, the largest queueing delay is just the size of the largest packet. It can’t really build up a big queue.
- The sender would have to worry about queuing delay on when the output rate is slower than the input rate.
    
    ![Untitled 6 81.png](../../attachments/Untitled%206%2081.png)
    
    - In this case, the queue can build up at a rate of `r = 999 kbit/s`.

# Packet Delay Variation

- **The reason there is variability in sending time (e.g. when you ping) is because of the queueing delay.**
    - The serialization delay will likely not change.
    - The propagation delay will likely not change.
    - Sometimes the packet will have to queue, and sometimes it won’t.
- Note: RTT stands for round-trip-time. This is the measurement when we ping.

![Untitled 7 78.png](../../attachments/Untitled%207%2078.png)

- The minimum RTT from Stanford to Princeton is around 95ms (look at the 0%)
- The median RTT from Stanford to Princeton is around 100ms (look at the 50%)
- The maximum RTT from Stanford to Princeton is around 330ms (look at the 100%)

# Router Queue

- The router queue is on the output of the router. It is right before the next output link
- There are two types of routers:
    - Store-and-forward: the entire packet must be received and stored before forwarding it
    - Cut-through: start forwarding as soon as bits of packet is received
- Below is a simple model of a router queue.
    
    - The number of arrivals is more than or equal to the number of departures.
    
    ![Untitled 8 73.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2073.png)
    
- If the router is connected to multiple links, each one has an output queue
    
    - Packets will have to wait in line until they can use a link to leave the router.
    
    ![Untitled 9 69.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2069.png)
    
- Below is a graph of the cumulatively number of bytes.
    
    - The red line is the input line. Packets can come in at any input rate.
    - The green line is the output line. They have a maximum rate, which is the link rate or data rate $r$﻿ of the output link.
    
    ![Untitled 10 66.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2010%2066.png)
    
- $Q(t)$﻿ is defined as $A(t) - D(t)$﻿ → queue is the number of packets waiting in the router.
    
    ![Untitled 11 64.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%2064.png)
    

## Store and Forward Graph

- The sloped part of $A(t)$﻿ is the packet arriving.
    - Once it has arrived, $A(t)$﻿ becomes constant. This means no more packets arriving.
- Once the packet arrives, $D(t)$﻿ starts sloping, meaning the packet is departing the router.
- It finishes departing at **0.55s = 0.05s (arriving thru A) + 0.50s (departing thru D)**
- Then, both are constant since while it waits for the next packet to arrive.

![Untitled 12 63.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%2063.png)

- The height of the line is the cumulative number of bits. Notice that $A(t)$﻿ first becomes constant at 500 bits, meaning the 500 bit packet has arrived.

## Average Occupancy in Queue

- Suppose we have the graph from above.
- The # of bits in the queue `from 0.55s to 1.00s` is `0 bits`
- The # of bits in the queue `from 0.00s to 0.05s` is increasing at a rate of `10,000 bits/s`
- The # of bits in the queue `from 0.05s to 0.55s` is decreasing at a rate of `1,000 bits/s`

![Untitled 13 61.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%2061.png)

- Above is the same graph as above.
    - The red line is $A(t)$﻿, the cumulative number of bits that arrived
    - The green line is $D(t)$﻿, the cumulative number of bits that departed
    - The blue line is $Q(t)$﻿, the number of bits in the queue
- **To find the average occupancy of the queue**
    - Calculate the average height of the blue line (ie. the function $Q(t)$﻿)
- In our case, the average occupancy of the queue during the 1 second interval is `137.5 bits`
    
    - For the first slope, its a linear line going from 0 to 500 bits. The average here is 250.
    - For the second slope, its linear line going from 500 to 0 bits. The average here is 250.
    - After 0.55s, the number of bits is zero.
    - To calculate the average, just take those averages multiplied by the percentage of time.
        - Since we have 1 second, the time itself is our percentage.
        - `(250 bits)(0.05) + (250 bits)(0.50) + (0s)(0.45) = 137.5 bits`

# Queue Discipline

- This discipline/policy defines how the router queue behaves when it’s filled up.
    - It can throw out packets from the beginning, from the end, ignore new packets, etc.

## DropTail

- This is the discipline where once the queue is filled up, you stop accepting new packets.
    - This assumes that the queue is FIFO.
- Called DropTail because you drop packest at the tail of the queue (ie. new packets)
- This is probably the most popular queue discipline.

# Cut through

- For a cut-through router, **its not possible for the output rate to exceed the input rate.**
    - Store-and-forward allows this though.
- As opposed to store and forward, cut through does not wait before resending the packet.
    - In a cut through router, the output link cannot be faster than the input link.
        - If the output is `100 b/s`, and the input is `10 b/s`, there’s not enough bits arriving at the router for the output to send out `100 b/s`.
- It sends it as soon as it receives the first bit. It does not need to have the whole packet before sending it.

![Untitled 15 55.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2015%2055.png)

- It takes `0.50s` to send the packet because the packet instantly starts departing, so $D(t)$﻿ instantly starts increasing. It sends at a rate of 1,000b/s, and there are 500 bits.
- In the first `0.05s`, the queue occupancy goes up at a rate of `A - D = 9,000 b/s`.
    - The maximum number of bits in the queue is now `450 bits`, since some departs before the full `500 bits` arrives.
- Using the same logic as before:
    - **The average occupancy** over the first `0.5s` is `450 / 2 = 225 bits`.
    - The average occupancy over the last `0.5s` is zero.
    - The overall average occupancy over one second is thus `(225 bits)(0.5) + (0 bits)(0.5) = 112.5 bits`
