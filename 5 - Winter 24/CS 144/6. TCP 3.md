# Structure Recap

- The sender is connected to the reader of a bytestream, whose writer is being used by the application.
- The reader is conencted to the writer of a bytestream, whose reader is controlled by the application.

- The above structure is the same for the other peer.

- Note that both peers are able to send and receive messages to one another.

# Example

- First, both peers send a message to each other.
    - This is Peer A
        
        ![Untitled 2 93.png](attachments/Untitled%202%2093.png)
        
    - This is Peer B
        
        ![Untitled 3 93.png](attachments/Untitled%203%2093.png)
        
    - Notice that the `ackno` is empty because they initially don’t know anything about each other.
    - Note also that the src port and dst port of the TCP segments are corresponding to one another
    - Below is a representation of what Peer B received from Peer A, along with the seqno
        
        ![Untitled 4 89.png](attachments/Untitled%204%2089.png)
        
- Then, after sending and receiving each other’s message, both peers will send another TCP segment message
    - This is Peer A
        
        ![Untitled 5 89.png](attachments/Untitled%205%2089.png)
        
    - This is Peer B
        
        ![Untitled 6 88.png](attachments/Untitled%206%2088.png)
        
    - Notice that the `ackno` is the ISN, offset by how many bytes have been added so far. It denotes the next byte it wants. There is also the one-byte offset for the SYN flag, as well as the one-byte offset for the FIN flag.
        - For Peer B, it’s `6969+13+1+1`, or `ISN + data.size + SYN + FIN`
    - Notice that they can **still send another message even when FIN was already sent.**
        - FIN denotes the end of the current bytestream message. It does not mean that the connection is over; it’s still alive.
- At this point, both sides have sent SYN and FIN, and both sides have acknowledge each other’s SYN and FIN and everything. This is now a **complete bidirectional** TCP connection.
- Now, suppose that the application on peer B did not close the bytestream, and instead pushed `push("not")` into the stream.
    - Now, the FIN flag from the original message would be false, the seqno would change, and we can send another TCP segment.
    - This is Peer B
        
        ![Untitled 7 85.png](attachments/Untitled%207%2085.png)
        
    - This is Peer A
        
        ![Untitled 8 79.png](attachments/Untitled%208%2079.png)
        

## Shorten

- It’s possible to send the same data using less TCP segments and datagrams.
    - We had to use 4 above because we assumed message 1 and 2 were sent at the same time.
- If we now have message 1 arriving first, we can send back a better acknowledgement, and only use 4 messages.
    - This is Peer A
        
        - It sends message 1. Then waits receives message 2 from the peer. Then sends message 3.
        
        ![Untitled 9 75.png](attachments/Untitled%209%2075.png)
        
    - This is Peer B
        
        - This side only sends message 2, and then receives message 3 from the peer, then its done.

# Three-way Handshake

- This is the name of the pattern described above. It’s an artifact of the rules of TCP.
- If we want a message to go to both sides, when they both just opened, we need three messages.
    
    ![Untitled 11 69.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%2069.png)
    
    - Peer A sends SYN and its (optional) data.
    - Peer B sends SYN, its (optional) data, and a valid ACK for what Peer A sent..
    - Peer A replies with the ACK for what Peer B sent.
- The first messages from both peers **must have SYN**, otherwise it would be dropped.
- The second message from B does not necessarily have to have an ACK. However, it must still happen, perhaps later, to acknowledge the SYN seqno received.

# Fully Formed Connection

- Four things have to happen before a connection is formed and started.
- We say that a TCP connection is fully formed once both sides have sent their ISN with the SYN flag, and both sides have acknowledged the segment containing the ISN and the SYN flag.
    - Sent two SYN flags and two acknowledgements.
- This can happen in three segments if one side sends first. Otherwise, if both sides send at the same time, it wouuld take four segments.

# Closing and Completing Connection

- Four things have to happen in order for a connection to complete and end.
- We say that a TCP connection is complete and finished once both sides have sent their FIN flag, and both sides have acknowledged every byte of the payload **and** the FIN flag.
    - Sent two FIN flags and two acknowledgements.

![Untitled 14 62.png](attachments/Untitled%2014%2062.png)

- Once the three segments above are sent and received, both peers know that they themselves are finished, and that their peer is also finished.
    
    ![Untitled 15 60.png](attachments/Untitled%2015%2060.png)
    
- From B’s perspective, it knows that all four things have happened, so it knows the connection is closed.
    - Step 1 was message 1, sent from A.
    - Step 2 and 4 was message 2, sent from B.
    - Step 3 was message 3, sent from A.
- From A’s perspective, it knows step 1, 2, and 4 have happened. It does not know for sure about step 3.
    - Step 1 is known because it got the ack from message 2.
    - Step 2 is known because it received it and sent message 3.
    - Step 4 is known because it got the ack from message 2.
    - **Step 3 is not known**. It does not receive an ack from B for message 3.
        - B will not send an ack message bc message 3 does not occupy a sequence number.

## Two Generals Problem

- The above is known as the two generals problem. At least one of the peers can never be sure that the other has received everything, since it would have to infinitely acknowledge the ack from each other.
    - The fix is that **A just stays alive and waits two minutes** once the program is finished, incase B did not receive message 3 and retransmits message 2 again.

- The peer that receives the FIN before it sends its own FIN does not have to wait.

# Fundamental Rules of TCP

1. Each peer is responsible for its outgoing byte stream.
2. Each sender assigns a sequence number to:
    1. SYN flag.
    2. Each byte of payload.
    3. FIN flag.
3. Each receiver’s `ackno` is the next desired `seqno`
4. Once the peer receives an incoming segment that uses any sequence numbers, it **must** reply.
5. If sender sends a segment and doesn’t receive an ack for it soon, it should timeout and retransmit until it gets an ack.

# Beginning a Connection

- In practice, the first TCP segment that’s sent will not have payload data. It’ll just contain the SYN flag, and the ISN.
    - This is because TCP connections are usually started using the `connect()` system call.
    - Once the connection is established, it’ll send data using `write()`
    - The receiver can use `listen()` to send that same initial reply with no paylod.
    - It can then use `accept()` to receive the data.
