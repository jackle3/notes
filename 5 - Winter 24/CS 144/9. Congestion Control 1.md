# Current stack

- Below is the stack that we’re considering so far.
    
    - TCP is built on top of IP datagrams, which is built on top of the physical layer and link-layer datagrams.
    - When we were talking about packet switching, that was talking about the **physical layer**

# Flow control

- TCP provides a **flow-controlled** bidirectional byte stream
    - “Flow-controlled” → the sender respects the receiver’s capacity
- Byte streams were also flow controlled → controlled by available capacity of the byte stream

## Network capacity

- **We can also consider the network’s capacity**
    - The limited resources of a network are the link speed and the maximum queue occupancy in the router.

# Single-flow, single-hop model

- Single-flow → there is one connection between the sender and the receiver
- Single-hop → even though there are two real hops, there’s only one that we care about.
    - The first hop from sender to queue is infinitely fast. We only care about the hop from queue to receiver.

- **From sender’s perspective, there are a few places packets can be**
    1. In the bottleneck queue of the router
    2. In transit on the link → in the process of being transported to the receiver
        1. Sender has finished sending the packet (putting it onto the link), but the receiver has not fully received it yet.
    3. At the receiver (arrived), with the acknowledgement currently transmitting to the sender.

# Bytestream model

- This is the original byte stream diagram.

- This diagram is what the **receiver** sees.

![Untitled 3 88.png](../../attachments/Untitled%203%2088.png)

- This diagram is what the **sender** sees.

# Windows

- The window serves as the **cap on the number of outstanding bytes**

![Untitled 5 84.png](../../attachments/Untitled%205%2084.png)

- The window size is an upperbound on the number of sequence numbers in flight.
- Q: What if the window size is really big?
- **Window size influences rate of data exchange (throughput) in stream**
- In the case below, the propagation delays are 1 second there and back.
    
    - The `r = 1Gbit/s` is the bottleneck link rate. That is the upper bound on the throughput.

## Small window size

- Q: What if the window size is really small (e.g. 1 byte)?
- Suppose the **window size is 1 byte**.
    - When the sender sends 1 byte, it takes 1 second to get to the receiver.
    - Then, it takes another second for the acknowledgement to get back to the sender.
    - **The sender can send a byte every 2 seconds.**
- From the perpsective of the user of TCP, the data transfer rate from the sender to the receiver is `0.5 bytes per second`, or `4 bits per second`.
- Even though the data rate of the link is `1Gbit/s`, because of the window size, the rate of bytes being written into the sender and read out of the receiver is only `4bits/s`.

## Throughput

- The `4bit/s` above is considered the throughput.
- Defined as the **number of bytes per second** being sent through the network.
- **Good put**: the throughput of the reliable byte stream assuming the data is new and good
    - This is because the sender can send the exact same seqno multiple times, in which case the throughput is zero because nothing will be read out.

## Big window size

- Q: What if the window size is really big?
    - This leads to congestion, since the sender overflows the queue of the router.
- This would lead by packets being dropped or lost.

- This **does not affect correctness** → eventually, the stream will be received correctly.

# Issue with congestion: Collapse

![Untitled 8 75.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2075.png)

- As the demand grows past a certain point, the amount of useful work collapses.

![Untitled 9 71.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2071.png)

![Untitled 10 67.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2010%2067.png)

- Even as the number of TCP connections grows, the number of bytes transferred by TCP declines.
- **Definition of Collapse:** decrease in the “good-put”, even as demand increases.

## How to get collapse

- As long as the second link is never doing duplicate work **and** never wasted, you can’t get congestion collapse.
    
    - E.g. as long as the same packet is not sent twice through the second link, and as long as the router queue is not empty.
    
    ![Untitled 11 65.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%2065.png)
    
- You can get collapse by a few things:
    - If the transmission link for the `ack` is broken, you can get collapse since the sender will retransmit segments that have already been received.
    - If the RTO goes off too early, it can retransmit a segment that would’ve been received.
        - Here, it concludes a packet was dropped even tho it was not dropped
- Another way to get collapse is to try to waste resources. Below is an example, where we now have two hops and two routers.
    
    ![Untitled 12 64.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%2064.png)
    
    - If we add another sender and receiver to the above example, we can more clearly see collapse.
    
    ![Untitled 13 62.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%2062.png)
    
    - S sends too many segments, taking up the entire second connection. Then, once it uses up that work, it gets dropped by the queue on the second A.
        - The packet made it across the first link, consumed it (meaning that S2 can’t use the link), and then got thrown away. This is wasted work.

# Issue with congestion: Fairness

## Fairness policies

- In this example,
    - A needs to cross one link (one hop).
    - B needs to cross one link (one hop).
    - C needs to cross two links (two hops).

![Untitled 16 53.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2016%2053.png)

- The sum of the A throughput and the C throughput can’t exceed 20 Mbit/s.
    - This is the first hop from x to y.
- The sum of the B throughput and the C throughput can’t exceed 10 Mbit/s.
    - This is the second hop from y to z.
- Below is a table of possible throughputs, along with the name of the associated policy for dividing the network.

|**Policy**|**A → a**|**B → b**|**C → c**|**Total Throughput**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|max-min fairness|15 Mbit/s|5 Mbit/s|5 Mbit/s|25 Mbit/s|

- Max-min fairness
    - → Makes the minimum throughput as big as possible (biggest minimum throughput you can get).
    - There’s no way to make the `min` throughput bigger than 5 Mbit/s.

|**Policy**|**A → a**|**B → b**|**C → c**|**Total Throughput**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|max utilization/efficiency|20 Mbit/s|10 Mbit/s|0 Mbit/s|30 Mbit/s|

- Max utilization/efficiency
    - → Most favorable for the owner of the links, since this is the maximum total efficiency they can get.

|**Policy**|**A → a**|**B → b**|**C → c**|**Total Throughput**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|proportionally fair|16 Mbit/s|6 Mbit/s|4 Mbit/s|26 Mbit/s|

- Proportionally fair
    - → Improvement of throughput by $x$﻿ requires harm of more than $1/x$﻿
    - C uses two different links, so they should be penalized a bit.
    - One person going from 1 to 10, at the expense of another going from 10 to 2 or 1.1.

| **Policy** | **A → a** | **B → b** | **C → c** | **Total Throughput** |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| best for C | 10 Mbit/s | 0 Mbit/s  | 10 Mbit/s | 20 Mbit/s            |

- This policy makes it so that C has the highest throughput (goodput) possible
    - This does not cause collapse. It does so at the expense of B.

|**Policy**|**A → a**|**B → b**|**C → c**|**Total Throughput**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|congestion collapse|0 Mbit/s|0 Mbit/s|~~20~~ 10 Mbit/s|10 Mbit/s|

- Congestion collapse
    - In this case, C is sending at a rate of 20 Mbit/s. However, it’s actual throughput is only 10 Mbit/s, since the second link has a limit.
    - This is collapse because B sending too much is causing the number of useful work to decrease, since some of its work is being wasted.

# Resource allocation

- We maximize a utility/happiness function $U_r$﻿ → this is some function of the throughout $x_r$﻿
- Subject to the limits of the network:
    - $\sum x_r \leq c_l$﻿ → the sum of all flows across the link does not exceed data rate of that link
    - Everyone’s throughout is zero or positive.

![Untitled 17 50.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2017%2050.png)

- Depending on how we define the utility/happiness function, we can achieve any of the fairness policies defined above.

## Other objectives

![Untitled 19 44.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2019%2044.png)

# Congestion Control

- This basically just means we have to have some way to make the sender send less bytes than the receiver is asking for
    - It needs to send only as much as the network can handle.
