# Recap

- Recall that the goal of TCP is to build a reliable bytestream on top of unreliable datagrams.

## Making datagrams reliable

- There are a few things we can do the fix the issues with unreliability within datagrams.
- **Delivered more than once:**
    - Make the datagram idempotent, so applying it more than once is the same as applying it once.
- **Delivered out of order:**
    - Datagrams should be commutable. This means modifying with indices such as with the reassembler.
- **Never delivered:**
    - Implement a reply or acknowledge system with the receiver, so that they can ask the sender to resend it.
- **Truncation or corruption of datagram:**
    - Header checksum (for IP datagrams)
    - Data checksum (for UDP datagrams)

# Transmission Control Protocol

- TCP is a protocol that provides reliable bytestreams over datagrams.
- It’s called this because it **controls** when each sender is allowed to transmit data.
    - A sender can only transmit when a peer has capacity.
- It’s built on top of UDP, since its header has port numbers.

# Rules of TCP

- It has a bytestream in both direction, so both computers (called peers) can send and receive information.
- **Every** byte is tagged with its place in the sequence.
    - The beginning of the stream (SYN) counts as one place in the sequence.
    - The end of the stream (FIN) counts as another place
- The receiver has to reply to the sender with
    - ackno: index of first unassembled byte (next byte that it needs)
    - window size: how many more bytes it’s willing to accept

# TCP Visualization

- Below is a visualization of what TCP looks like. There are two peers, each of which has its own sender and receiver module.
- Notice that TCP is built on top of UDP, which is built on top of internet datagrams.

- Data that is put into the writer of one peer is fed to the sender, which sends it to the receiver of the other peer.
- This receiver then feeds the received data into the reader of the other peer.

# Messages

- There is a sending message and a receiving message.
- Every datagram that is sent in either direction contains both a sender message and a receiver message, stacked on each other.

## Sending Message

- The sending message is sent from a sender to a receiver, contains:
    - seqno: the relative sequence number of the data
    - payload: the data being sent
    - FIN: a bool flag denoting whether this is last sequence
    - RST: reset flag
    - SYN: a bool flag denoting whether this is first sequence
- Because of TCP, the sender **will not** send messages that violate the conditions that it has from the receiver message.
    - Suppose peer A received `ACK {ackno: 6, win_size: 5}`
    - Peer A can’t send a message `{seqno: 20, data: "..."}` because it will exceed the stream.
- It is up to the discretion of the receiver on how to handle violating messages.
    - It can either accept and truncate the message, or reply with RST
- If the sender sends a message that is **stored in internal storage** and not pushed to the stream, the reply from the receiver **does not change**.

## Receiver Message

- The receiver message is sent from the receiver back to the sender
    - acko: first unassembled index
    - window_size: the number of bytes that it’s willing to accept
        - Equal to the available capacity of the byte stream
- The receiver reply message **does not acknowledge red regions** within the internal storage
    - Red regions are chunks in the internal storage that is stored but not yet pushed.

## Reset Flag

- A “RST” bool found in both the sender and receiver message.
- It’s sets to true when there is an error in the stream → it’s purpose is to reset the connection and shut down the stream.
    - Call `reader.set_error()` or `writer.set_error()` when the `RST` flag is present.

## FIN Flag

- Once the last substring is set, `FIN` flag will be set to true.
- Once the receiver assembles the last substring, it will send an **idx past the last idx**, to show that FIN was received and pushed.

## SYN Flag

- If this flag is true, that means that the number in the `seqno` field is the ISN.
- This means that the data starts at `seqno + 1` when the SYN flag is true, and starts at `seqno` otherwise.
- The ISN is a **random starting number** for the first sequence number of the data in the stream.

## Window Size

- Suppose a sender got a receiver message with `seqno: 6983` and `win_size: 1000`.
- This means that the sender, without hearing anything else from the other peer, can send any segment with sequence number between `6983` and `7982`.
- Generally, there is a default guess at the window size before the first segment and acknowledge is received.
    - The receiver is responsible for advertising its own window size to the sender.

## Retransmitting

- In this example, it first sends a message at index 6 then another message at index 11.
- Since the ACK is still 6 after sending the message at index 6, it knows that the message at index 6 was not delivered.
    - The sender would then retransmit this message.

# Sequence numbers

- The sequence number is 32-bit, and it’s the thing that is sent in the TCP datagram.
    - It starts from the ISN and goes up, wrapping every $2^{32}$﻿ bits
- The absolute sequence number is technically infinite, but usually considered to be 64-bit.
    - It starts from 0 and goes up, denoting the index of the data in the stream.
- The stream index is the absolute sequence number but excluding the SYN and FIN numbers.

# TCP Header

- The TCP header contains all of the information that a traditional UDP header has, in addition to the sender and receiver messages.

![Untitled 10 75.png](attachments/Untitled%2010%2075.png)

- Notice that the there is only one `RST` flag. This is because it belongs to both the sender and the receiver.
- Every segment, except for the first one from each peer, will have the `ack` flag set to true.
    - Once a peer has received ISN from its peer, it will have some form of acknowledgement.

# TCP vs UDP

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both protocols used for sending bits of data—known as packets—over the Internet, but they do so in different ways.
    - TCP is like a phone call, it establishes a connection between two devices (a handshake) and maintains it throughout the session, ensuring reliable, ordered, and error-checked transmission of data. It's ideal for applications where accuracy is crucial, like web browsing or email.
    - UDP, on the other hand, is like mailing a letter; it sends packets without establishing a connection, making it faster but less reliable. It doesn't guarantee packet delivery, order, or error checking, making it suitable for applications like video streaming or online gaming where speed is more important than precision.
- The fact that a TCP segment includes two port numbers and a checksum means that, intellectually speaking, TCP is built on top of the concepts of a user datagram; a TCP segment includes the same fields as a user datagram for the same purpose (but not in the same order as an official User Datagram)
