### Assembly

* Pros:
  * Very simple instructions
  * Extremely fast when well-written
  * Complete control over your program
* Cons:
  * A lot of code to do simple tasks
  * Very hard to understand
  * Very unportable (can't really move from one computer to another)

### C

C made it easy to write code the was fast, simple, and cross-platform. Code is written in an intuitive language, with an additional program that converts it to Assembly.

This additional program is called a **compiler**. Compilers will be taught in **CS143**.

However, it had a few weaknesses:

* No objects or classes
* Difficult to write generic code
* Tedious when writing large programs

C will mainly be learned in **CS107**.

### C++

C++ has the same advantages as C but has many high-level features that make it more usable.

It only has features only if they solve an actual problem. To make it fast, it skips a lot of the checks.

* Compartmentalization is key
* It does not sacrifice performance except as a last resort
* Code safety is enforced at compile time whenever possible

### Basic Syntax of C++

* Semicolons at EOL
* Primitive types (ints, doubles, etc.)
* Basic grammar rules

### The STL (Standard Library)

* Tons of general functionality
* Built in classes like maps, sets, and vectors
* Accessed through the namespace std::

### Namespaces

* Many common functions are in the `std::` namespace.
* CS 106B always uses `using namespace std;` to automatically add std:: for you.
* CS 106L won't use it most of the time, since **it's not good style**

### Types

```cpp
#include <string>
int val = 5; //32 bits
char ch = 'F'; //8 bits (usually)
float decimalVal1 = 5.0; //32 bits (usually)
double decimalVal2 = 5.0; //64 bits (usually)
bool bVal = true; //1 bit
std::string str = "Sarah";
```

C++ is a statically typed language. This means that everything with a name (variables, functions, etc.) is given a name **before runtime**.

* In contrast, dynamically typed (like Python) gives a type at runtime based on the item's current value.

In dynamically typed languages, also known as interpreted, types are checked during execution, line by line. In statically typed languages, also known as compiled, types are checked during compilation.

```python
def div_3(x):
    return x / 3
div_3(“hello”)
```

This will crash during runtime, since you can't divide a string.

```cpp
int div_3(int x) {
	return x / 3;
}
div_3(“hello”)
```

This will cause a compile error, since you can't pass a string into an int.

Static typing helps us prevent errors before our code runs.

```cpp
int add(int a, int b);
	int, int -> int
string echo(string phrase);
	string -> string
string helloworld();
	void -> string
double divide(int a, int b);
	int, int -> double // for this, you have to explicitly cast as double with the two ints
```

Here are a few examples of functions and their respective parameter and return types.

### Overloading

Used for when we want two versions of a function for two different types (e.g. int division and double division).

```cpp
int half(int x) {
    std::cout << "int" << endl;
    return x / 2;
}

double half(double x) {
    std::cout<< "double" << endl;
    return x / 2;
}

half(3); // this will use the int function, returns 1
half(3.0); // this will use the double function, returns 1.5
```

You can also have **optional parameters** in your functions.

```cpp
int half(int x, int divisor = 2) { // (1)
	return x / divisor;
}
double half(double x) { // (2)
	return x / 2;
}
half(4) // uses version (1), returns 2
half(3, 3) // uses version (1), returns 1
half(3.0) // uses version (2), returns 1.5
```

### Structs

Structs are a group of named variables each with their own type. It's a way to bundle different types together.

```cpp
struct Student {
    string name; // these are called fields
    string state; // separate these by semicolons
    int age;
};

Student s;
s.name = "Sarah";
s.state = "CA";
s.age = 21; // use . to access fields
```

You can use structs to pass around grouped information for use.

```cpp
Student s;
s.name = "Sarah";
s.state = "CA";
s.age = 21; // use . to access fields

void printStudentInfo(Student student) {
    cout << student.name << " from " << student.state;
    cout << " (" << student.age << ")" << endl;
}

printStudentInfo(s); // prints "Sarah from CA (21)"
```

You can also use structs to return grouped information.

```cpp
Student randomStudentFrom(std::string state) {
    Student s;
    s.name = "Sarah"; //random = always Sarah
    s.state = state;
    s.age = std::randint(0, 100);
    return s;
}

Student foundStudent = randomStudentFrom("CA");
cout << foundStudent.name << endl; // prints "Sarah"
```

You can also use abbreviated syntax to initialize the struct.

```cpp
Student s;
s.name = "Sarah";
s.state = "CA";
s.age = 21;

//is the same as ...

Student s = {"Sarah", "CA", 21}; // place the parameters in the order of the struct declaration
```

### Pair

`std::pair` is an STL built-in struct with two fields *of any time*.

* `std::pair` is a *template*: You can specify the types of thre fields inside `<>` for each pair object you make.
* The fields in `std::pair` are named first and second.

```cpp
std::pair<int, string> numSuffix = {1,"st"};
cout << numSuffix.first << numSuffix.second; // prints "1st"
```

This is how the pair struct is defined.

```cpp
struct Pair {
    fill_in_type first;
    fill_in_type second;
};
```

`std::pair` is generally used to return success (boolean) and the result.

```cpp
std::pair<bool, Student> lookupStudent(string name) {
    Student blank;
    if (found(name))
        return std::make_pair(false, blank);
    Student result = getStudentWithName(name);
    return std::make_pair(true, result);
}
std::pair<bool, Student> output = lookupStudent(“Julie”);
```

To avoid specifying the types of a pair, you can use `std::make_pair(field1, field2)`.

### Auto

`auto` is a keyword that can be used in lieu of type when declaring a variable. It tells the compiler to deduce the type of the variable.

```cpp
auto a = 3; // this is an int
auto b = 4.3; // this is a double
auto c = ‘X’; // this is a char
auto d = “Hello”; // this is a char*, as known as a C string
auto e = std::make_pair(3, “Hello”); // this is a std::pair<int, char*>
```

*Note*: `auto` does not mean that the variable doesn’t have a type. It means that the type is **deduced** by the compiler. Therefore, you can't set the variable to a different type than it's original type.

### Code Demo

```cpp
// quadratic.cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> //gives us pow and sqrt!

using std::string; using std::cout;
using std::cin; using std::pow;
using std::sqrt; using std::endl;

//want: a function named quadratic that will take in 3 doubles and return
//a combination of: does a solution exist, and if so, what is it?
	//get radical, test if negative, return indicating no roots
	// radical = b^2 - 4ac
	
	//otherwise get roots and return
	// root1 = (-b + sqrt(radical)) divided by 2a
	// root2 = (-b - sqrt(radical)) divided by 2a

std::pair<bool, std::pair<double, double> > quadratic(double a, double b, double c) {
    double radical = pow(b, 2) - (4*a*c);
    if (radical < 0) {
        return std::make_pair(false, std::make_pair(-1, -1));
    }
    
    double root1 = (-b + sqrt(radical)) / (2*a);
    double root2 = (-b - sqrt(radical)) / (2*a);
    return std::make_pair(true, std::make_pair(root1, root2));
}

int main() {
	//get 3 doubles (ax^2 + bx + c)
	double a, b, c;
	cout << "Give me 3 coefficients: " << endl;
	
	//This line gets 3 numbers from user input and stores them in a, b and c 
	//we will learn more about cin on Thursday
	cin >> a >> b >> c;

	//some call to quadratic function!
    auto res = quadratic(a, b, c); // using auto bc the type is super long
    bool exists = res.first;
    auto roots = res.second;
    
    //get roots if they exist
    if (exists) {
        double root1 = roots.first;
        double root2 = roots.second;
        cout << "Solutions are: " << root1 << ", " << root2 << endl;
    }
    else {
        cout << "No solutions exists!" << endl;
    }
	return 0;
}

// Test: x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, roots = -3, -2

// To run: first compile code --> make quadratic, 
// then run the compiled code --> ./quadratic
```

## Tuesday, October 4

Today, we will talk about streams

---

### STL naming conventions

* **STL** = Standard Template Library
* The namespace of the STL is **std**
  * To access elements in STL, use **std::**

---

### Streams

An abstraction for input/output. Streams convert between data and the string representation of data.

**cout** is a stream that we have used before.

```cpp
// use a stream to print any primitive type!
std::cout << 5 << std::endl;
// you can also use it to print most things from the STL work!
std::cout << "Sarah" << std::endl;
// you can also mix different types
std::cout << "Sarah is " << 21 << std::endl;
// however, there are some issues with structs
Student s = {"Sarah", "CA", 21};
std::cout << s << std::endl; // this will error
std::cout << s.name << s.age << std::endl; // this will work
```

To print a struct, you print the individual elements of the struct, instead of the entire struct itself.

Printing any primitive type and most things from the STL will work. For other types, you will have to write the `<<` operator yourself.

---

### Output Streams

* Output streams have type **std::ostream**
  * **std::cout** is an output stream
* They convert any type into a string and sends it to the stream.

```cpp
std::cout << 5 << std::endl;
// converts int value 5 to string “5”
// sends “5” to the console output stream
```



---

### Output File Streams

* Output file streams have type **std::ofstream**
* Only sends data using the `<<` operator
* They convert data of any type into a string and sends it to the **file** stream.
* Must initialize your own **ofstream** object linked to your file.

```cpp
std::ofstream out(“out.txt”);
// out is now an ofstream that outputs to out.txt
out << 5 << std::endl; // out.txt contains 5
```

To use the `ofstream`, the file must already exist. 

---

**Note**

* `std::cout` is a global constant object that you get from `#include <iostream>`
  * To use any other output stream, you must first initialize it!

---

### Code Demo for ostreams

```cpp
// What do we need to include?
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>

// No using namespace std;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::string;

// TODO: function to write num to any ostream
void writeToAnyOStream(std::ostream& anyOStream, int anyNum) {
    anyOStream << "Write anyNum: " << anyNum << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Write an int to the user's console.
    int myNum = 42;
    cout << "The answer is: " << myNum << endl;

    // Write an int to a file.
    std::ofstream out_stream("out.txt");

    out_stream << "The answer is: " << myNum << endl;
    

    // TODO: Write method to take any ostream
    writeToAnyOStream(cout, myNum + 1); // prints to console output
    writeToAnyOStream(out_stream, myNum + 1); // prints to file "out.txt"
   
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Input Streams

```cpp
int x;
std::cin >> x;
// what happens if input is 5? ---> x = 5
// how about 51375? ---> x = 51375
// how about 5 1 3 7 5? ---> x = 5
```

* Input streams have type **std::istream**.
  * **std::cin** is an input stream.
    * `std::cin` is a global constant object that you get from `#include <iostream>`
* Input streams can only receive strings using the `>>` operator. It receives a string from the stream and converts it into data.

```cpp
int x;
string str;
std::cin >> x >> str;
//reads exactly one int then one string from console
```

### Details about std::cin

* First call to `std::cin >>` creates a command line prompt that allows the user to type until they hit enter
* Each `>>` only reads until the next whiteface (tab, space, newline)
* Everything after the first whitespace gets saved and used the next time `std::cin >>` is called.
  * Whitespace is eaten, it won't show up in the output.
* If there is nothing waiting in the buffer, `std::cin >>` creates a new command line prompt.

**Example**

```cpp
// Assume input strings is "48 ab 4\n".

int x; string y; int z;
cin >> x; //42 put into x
cin >> y; //ab  put into y
cin >> z; // 4 put into z
```

### Issues with Input Streams

```cpp
string str;
int x;
std::cin >> str >> x;
std::cout << str << x;
```

What happens if input is blah blah? ie. ignoring the type of x

* This will fail. It won't crash, but it will fail. 

```cpp
// if wee pass in blah blah blah
This is str: blah
This is x: 0
This is otherStr: 
```

Once an error is detected, the input stream’s fail bit is set, and it will no longer accept input. The fail bit will return a 0 (ie. like how `x=0`). However, the existing things in the input stream is still contained in there.

```CPP
int age; double hourlyWage;
cout << "Please enter your age: ";
cin >> age;
cout << "Please enter your hourly wage: ";
cin >> hourlyWage;
// What happens if first input is 2.17?
```

This program will make `age = 2` and `hourlyWage = .17`. The stream is not empty, there's still stuff let in there even after age has been set to a value.

---

### std::getline()	

The method signature of getline() is defined as `istream& getline(istream& is, string& str, char delim)`;

* **is** = Stream to read from, **str** = Place where input from stream is stored, **delim** = When to stop reading (‘\n’ if not specified)

This method is used read a string or line from an input stream.

**How does getline work?**

* Clears contents in **str**
* Extracts chars from **is** and stores them in **str** until one of three things happens:
  1. End of file condition on **is**, sets EOF bit (can be checked using is.eof())
  2. Next char in **is** is delim, extracts but does not store delim
  3. **str** max size is reached, sets FAIL bit (can be checked using is.fail())
* If no chars extracted for any reason, FAIL bit set

Reading input using `>>` extracts a single "word" or type, including strings

To read a whole line, use `std::getline(istream& stream, string& line);`

* Note that getline takes in both parameters by reference.

```cpp
std::string line;
std::getline(cin, line); // now line has changed!
// say the user entered “Hello World 42!”
std::cout << line << std::endl;
// should print out “Hello World 42!”
```

**Don’t mix >> with getline**

* `>>` reads up to the next whitespace character and does not go past that whitespace character.
* getline reads up to the next delimiter (by default, ‘\n’), and does go past that delimiter.
* Don’t mix the two or bad things will happen!
  * If you need to mix them, you can put `cin.ignore()` in your code. This will also eat up the delimiter, similar to how `getline()` works.

---

### Input File Streams

* Input file streams have type `std::ifstrean`
* Only receives strings using the `>>` operator.
  * Receives strings from a file and converts it to data of any type.
* Must initialize your own `ifstream` object linked to your file

```cpp
std::ifstream in(“out.txt”);
// in is now an ifstream that reads from out.txt
string str;
in >> str; // first word in out.txt goes into str
```

---

### Stringstreams

Input stream: **std::istringstream**

* Give any data type to the istringstream, it'll store it as a string.

```cpp
Student reverseJudgementCall(string judgement) {
    // user input from command prompt: “Sarah age 21, rocks”
    std::istringstream converter;
    string fluff;
    int age;
    bool lovesCpp;
    string name;
    
    converter >> name; // takes in "Sarah"
    converter >> fluff; // takes in " age
    converter >> age; // takes in 21
    converter >> fluff; // takes in ", "
    string cool;
    converter >> cool; // takes in "rocks"
    if(cool == "rocks")
        return Student{name, age, "bliss"};
    else
        return Student{name, age, "misery"};
} // returns: {“Sarah”, 21, “bliss”}
```

Output stream: **std::ostringstream**

* Make an ostringstream out of a string, read from it word by word or type by type.

```cpp
string judgementCall(int age, string name,
bool lovesCpp)
{
    std::ostringstream formatter;
    formatter << name <<", age " << age;
    if(lovesCpp) formatter << ", rocks.";
    else formatter << " could be better";
    return formatter.str();
}
```

## Thursday, October 6

Today we will learn about initialization and references.

---

### Streams Recap

* `<<` is the stream insertion operator. It is used for output streams to "insert" data into the stream.
* `>>` is the stream extraction operator. It is used for input streams to "extract" data from the stream.

### Details about std::cin

* First call to `std::cin >>` creates a command line prompt for user input
* Each `>>` only reads until the next whitespace
  * Everything else gets saved in the buffer. If there is nothing else in the buffer, it creates a new command prompt.
* Whitespace is eaten. It will not show up in output.

---

### Initialization

This is the way in which we provide initial values to variables.

Recall that there are two ways to initialize a struct,

```cpp
Student s; // option 1 (initialization after we declare)
s.name = "Sarah";
s.state = "CA";
s.age = 21;

Student s = {"Sarah", "CA", 21}; // option 2 (initialization while we declare)
```

and three ways to initialize a pair

```cpp
std::pair<int, string> numSuffix1 = {1,"st"}; // option 1

std::pair<int, string> numSuffix2; // option 2
numSuffix2.first = 2;
numSuffix2.second = "nd";

std::pair<int, string> numSuffix2 =std::make_pair(3, "rd"); // option 3
```

**Uniform Initialization**: curly bracket initialization. Available for all types, it provides immediate initialization on declaration.

```cpp
std::vector<int> vec{1,3,5};
std::pair<int, string> numSuffix1{1,"st"};
Student s{"Sarah", "CA", 21};
// less common/nice for primitive types, but
possible!
int x{5};
string f{"Sarah"};
```

Be careful with vector initialization. Use brackets for uniform initialization and not parentheses. 

```cpp
std::vector<int> vec1(3,5); // parentheses
// makes {5, 5, 5}, not {3, 5}!
// uses a std::initializer_list (more later)

std::vector<int> vec2{3,5}; // curly brace
// makes {3, 5}
```

---

### Auto

* You can't use auto when declaring variables for the first time.

  * `auto a, b, c;` will crash

* Also don't use auto if it makes the code less clear

  ```cpp
  auto result = quadratic(a, b, c);
  auto found = result.first; // this makes it less clear bc we don't know the type of found
  ```

Just use auto to reduce long type names.

---

### Structured Binding

This lets you initialize directly from the contents of a struct

```cpp
// Before
auto p = std::make_pair(“s”, 5);
string a = p.first;
int b = p.second;
```

```cpp
// After
auto p = std::make_pair(“s”, 5);
auto [a, b] = p;
// a is string, b is int
// auto [a, b] = std::make_pair(...);
```

You can use auto to achieve something similar to tuple unpacking in Python. This idea can be used to make code much cleaner.

This is the quadratic program from before without using structured binding.

```cpp
int main() {
    auto a, b, c;
    std::cin >> a >> b >> c;
    auto result = quadratic(a, b, c);
    auto found = result.first;
    if (found) {
        auto solutions = result.second;
        std::cout << solutions.first << solutions.second << endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << “No solutions found!” << endl;
    }
}
```

This is the same program using structured binding.

```cpp
int main() {
	auto a, b, c;
	std::cin >> a >> b >> c;
    auto [found, solutions] = quadratic(a, b, c);
    if (found) {
        auto [x1, x2] = solutions;
        std::cout << x1 << “ ” << x2 << endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << “No solutions found!” << endl;
    }
}
```

---

### References

An alias (another name) for a named variable.

```cpp
void changeX(int& x){ // changes to x will persist
    x = 0;
}
void keepX(int x){
    x = 0;
}
int a = 100;
int b = 100;
changeX(a); // a becomes a reference to x
keepX(b); // b becomes a copy of x
cout << a << endl; // prints 0
cout << b << endl; // prints 100
```

---

### Vectors

We will compare the vector class from the Stanford library with the one from the STL (std::vector).

**Stanford library vector:**

```cpp
Vector<int> v;
Vector<int> v(n, k);
v.add(k);
v[i] = k;
auto k = v[i];
v.isEmpty();
v.size();
v.clear();
v.insert(i, k);
v.remove(i);
```

**STL vector:**

```cpp
std::vector<int> v;
std::vector<int> v(n, k);
v.push_back(k);
v[i] = k;
auto k = v[i];
v.empty();
v.size();
v.clear();
// stay tuned
// stay tuned
```

**References to variables**

```cpp
vector<int> original{1, 2}; // creating a vector using uniform intilization
vector<int> copy = original; // copy of the original vector
vector<int>& ref = original; // reference to the original vector
original.push_back(3); // adds to original
copy.push_back(4); // adds to copy
ref.push_back(5); // adds to original

cout << original << endl; // prints {1, 2, 3, 5}
cout << copy << endl; // prints {1, 2, 4}
cout << ref << endl; // prints {1, 2, 3, 5}
```

These are common bugs with the use of references:

```cpp
void shift(vector<std::pair<int, int>>& nums) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        auto [num1, num2] = nums[i]; // this creates a copy of the pair in nums
        // these only update the copy, not the original pair in nums
        num1++;
        num2++; 
    }
}
```

```cpp
void shift(vector<std::pair<int, int>>& nums) {
    for (auto [num1, num2]: nums) { // this also creates a copy of the pair
        // these only update the copy
        num1++;
        num2++;
    }
}
```

However, this will work:

```cpp
void shift(vector<std::pair<int, int>>& nums) {
    for (auto& [num1, num2]: nums) { // this is a reference to the pair
        num1++;
        num2++;
    }
}
```

---

### L-values vs r-values

**l-values**

* l-values can appear on the **left** or the **right** side of an equal sign

* Example:

  ```cpp
  int x = 3;
  int y = x;
  ```

  * Here, x is an l-value

* l-values have names

* l-values are not temporary

**r-values**

* r-values can only appear on the **right** side of an equal sign

* Example:

  ```cpp
  int x = 3;
  int y = x;
  ```

  * Here, 3 is an r-value

* r-values don't have names

* r-values are temporary

```cpp
void shift(vector<std::pair<int, int>>& nums) {
    for (auto& [num1, num2]: nums) {
        num1++;
        num2++;
    }
}
shift({{1, 1}});
// {{1, 1}} is an rvalue, it can’t be referenced
```
