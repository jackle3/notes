Today, we're covering behavioral finance.

---

There are a few things that make people not rational with their money.

* Anchoring, Mental Accounting, Confirmation & Hindsight Bias, Gambler's Fallacy, Herd Behavior, Overconfidence, Recency & Availability Bias, Loss Aversion

---

### Three themes in behavioral economics

1. **Heuristics**: The vast majority of human decisions are using mental shortcuts or rules of thumbs.
2. **Framing**: Humans use anecdotes and stereotypes to understand and respond to events.
3. **Market Inefficiencies**: Mis-pricing or non-rational decision making.

---

### Anchoring

* People estimate answers to new and novel problems with a bias towards reference points (numbers they've heard before).
  * E.g. price you bought a stock at compared to a high point for a stock
* Numbers stick in our head, and if we're asked a question with an answer near that number, it would shift our estimates.

---

### Mental Accounting

* Money is fungible (could be used for anything), but people tend to put labels on their money. They like to put it into separate "mental accounts." This is also known as "bucketing."
* Example: Lost movie tickets
  * If a person has \$80 and bought 2 movie tickets for $40 but lost the tickets, they would struggle to spend the remaining \$40 on a new pair of movie tickets.
  * If a person has \$80 but lost \$40 in an unrelated way, they would be fine with spending the remaining \$40 on movie tickets.
  * This is because once you've bought the tickets, the mental accounting has taken place and the initial \$40 has been labeled as "movie ticket money."

---

### Confirmation & Hindsight Bias

**Confirmation Bias**: We selectively seek information that supports pre-existing theories, and we ignore/dispute information that challenges or disproves them.

**Hindsight Bias**: We overestimate our ability to predict the future based on the "obviousness" of the past.

The combination of both biases can be particularly bad. If you're overconfident about predicting the future (hindsight bias) and you ignore information that goes against your pre-existing theory (confirmation bias), you can make some very bad decisions.

---

### Gambler's Fallacy

* We see patterns in independent, random chains of events.
* We believe that, based on a series of previous events, an outcome is more likely than odds actually suggest.
* Example: If we see that a roulette wheel is landing on red more than black, we may think that the wheel is more likely to land on red even though it's a random event.

---

### Herd Behavior

* We have a tendency to mimic the actions of the large group
  * It's easier to be "wrong with everyone" than to be "right and alone."
* Going against the crowd creates stress and fatigue. It gets harder, not easier.

---

### Overconfidence

* A lot of people overestimate their performance. In a 2016 survey, 74% of investment managers believed that they deliver above-average performance.
* **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: The more poorly you perform, the more you overestimate your performance.
* Capability in one domain of life can lead to overconfidence in other domains.
  * Humility is a virtue.

---

### Recency & Availability Bias

* **Recency Bias**: We overreact to recent events. (e.g. celebrity illnesses, scandals)
* **Availability Bias**: We assume the data we have been provided is representative of the entire data set.

Since there are so much more information about recent events than previous events, we might think that the data from the recent events is representative of all events.

---

### Loss Aversion (Prospect Theory)

Example 1:

* You have $1000 and you must pick one of the following games.
  1. You have a 50% chance of gaining \$1000, and a 50% chance of gaining \$0.
  2. You have a 100% chance of gaining \$500.

Example 2:

* You have $2000 and you must pick one of the following games.
  1. You have a 50% chance of losing $1000, and a 50% chance of losing \$0.
  2. You have a 100% chance of losing $500.

For all four options in both games, the expected value is $1500. However, some choices are easier to make for people than others.

* We hate losses more than we love winning.
  * Average loss aversion is between 2:1 and 3:1.
* We hate being responsible for decisions that could result in a loss.

Example: **"Sunk Cost"** mistakes with investments.

Today, we're covering compensation.

---

Compensation has multiple uses in a company

* **Attract** talent by rewarding capability
* **Motivate** employees by rewarding performance
* **Retain** employees by matching their contribution to the company

Components of compensation

* Base Pay (salary or hourly rate)
* Relocation / signing bonus
* Annual bonus
* Equity compensation
* Financial benefits
* Perks

---

### Base Pay

* **Key Factors**: Level, Function, Geography
* Adjustments are most commonly made due to annual inflation, internal audit, market competitiveness, and promotions
  * Market data is easily accessible by companies, increasingly accessible to individuals

---

### Bonus

* **Signing / Relocation Bonus**: money paid up-front at the first pay period to help with moving / relocation, or to improve offer without affecting base salary.
  * Usually has a clawback (e.g. must be paid back if you leave the company before a certain time, helps with retention)
* **Annual / Quarterly Performance Bonus**: Typically a company wide program, based on individual and company results.
* **Spot Bonus**: Less common, but managers sometimes give one-off bonus to teams or individuals to reward results.

---

### Equity Compensation

* Designed to align employee compensation with shareholder results
  * Since the employee owns a small part of the company, when the shareholder results are positive, it's better for the employee
* It is particularly attractive to companies that are cash sensitive
* Equity compensation is very common at all levels and roles in technology
  * Other industries tend to only give equity to executives
* Two common forms of equity compensation:
  * Stock options and restricted stock

---

### Financial Benefits and Perks

* Wide variety of benefits that either offer employees tax advantage or shifts costs to the employer
* Some of the most significant are health Insurance, retirement, and stock purchase plans
  * Health insurance (could be much cheaper and more high quality than regular), retirement (401K), stock purchase plans (can get stocks at a discounted price)
* There are also some fairly expensive perks at well-funded tech companies
  * Food, transit, fitness
* Benefits tend to be very uneven in value to employees depending on their personal situation and needs

---

### Equity (Ownership of a company, stock)

* Fancy name for the value of a share of ownership of the business
* Company ownership is often divided into shares, and those shares entitle owners to various rights
  * There can be different classes of shares. This is very common with private companies.
* In the simplest case, you can determine how much of a company you own using the fraction $$\frac{\text{\# of shares you own}}{\text{\# of shares total}}$$.

---

### Public Companies

* Out of ~5.8 million employer businesses in the US, fewer than 4000 are publicly traded.
  * 99.7% of these have fewer than 500 employees
* Public companies tend to be larger, as measured in employees and revenue
* There are strict regulations for public companies on timeliness and content of financial results published for the public
  * Market price for both stock and stock options are extremely transparent

---

### Private Companies

* Most businesses are private, the most relevant form are **venture-backed startups**
* Private companies usually have multiple share classes, and are frequently cashflow negative
  * Many private companies are still private because they are not profitable yet
* Future financing means **dilution**
  * Your share of the company will decrease as the company issues more shares as they get more funding
* You cannot evaluate a company's equity without knowing the amount of money raised and at what terms and preferences
* Companies vary widely in how much they disclose to their employees and candidates
* For the most part, you can't sell your stock when a company is private

---

### Stock Options

* The right to buy a stock
  * Also sometimes called "call options"
* You must vest the option in order to get the stock, exercise the option
* A 10-year stock option might mean that "anytime in the next 10 years, you can buy 100 stocks at $140, the current price of the stock"
  * This can be extremely profitable if in 10 years he stock is now greater than $140

---

### Restricted Stock

* A broad term for shares in a company that have restrictions on their ownership (e.g. vesting)
* Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) are a promise from a company to issue shares to the employee.
  * Restricted Stock are actual shares with a restriction on them.
* You own income tax right away when you vest restricted stock. Most companies without taxes by selling the portion of stock necessary at that time.
  * A 200 stock thing might become 160 after tax.
* There is no strike price. You are granted a number of shares with a vesting schedule.

---

### Stock Options vs Restricted Stock

* Sock options are worthless if the value of the stock drop below the exercise price of the option. Restricted stock only becomes worthless if the price drops to zero.
* Employees typically receive more shares via stock options than via restricted stock, because the restricted stock lacks a strike price and is worth more than an option. Ratio can be 3 to 1.
