# “Entry” construction for Texas Valero Open

- Every golfer has his performance in the tournament converted into **fantasy points** computed from variable outcomes in the golfer’s performance in real life.
- For the tournament, each golfer has a “salary” set by DraftKings (a DFS site).
    - Newbie golfers in the PGA are around $6,000
    - Historically good golfers are around $11,000+
- An “entry” consists of exactly six golfers, and the sum of the salaries cannot exceed $50,000.
- The score of an entry is the sum of the fantasy points obtained by the six golfers are the tournament.
- All the entries must be submitted before the tournament starts.

## Fantasy Points for PGA

- Points for
    1. **Per Hole Scoring**
    2. **Streaks and Bonuses**
    3. **Tournament Finishing**
- Fantasy sports for golf are always functions of what happens at each hole.

## Strategies

- In terms of payouts for the tournament, it’s extremely top heavy.
    - The top 9600 entries win a prize, but the top 6 entries make up 50% of the prize pool.
- You can either go for a high projected median, or a high projected variance.
    - High projected median can theoretically double your money
    - If the variance hits right, you can maybe hit in the top 6 and get a huge payout.

# Golf rules

- A golf course has 18 holes.
- Each hole has a par score — the expected number of strokes for an average PGA Tour player required to complete the hole.
- The score on a hole is — the number of strokes to complete the hole minus the par score.
    
    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## PGA tournaments

- A PGA tournament lasts 4 days.
- All players play on Day 1 and Day 2
- The top half of the entrants “make the cut” and play on Days 3 and 4
    - Players who make the cut play 72 holes.
    - Players who miss the cut play 36 holes.

## Types of golf shots

- Driver shots go far (250 - 320 yd) with little control → **off the tee**
- Iron shots go medium distance (130 - 240 yd) with slightly more control → **approach**
- Wedge shorts go short distance (30 - 100 yd) with high control → **around the green**
- Putts roll ball on the green → **putting**

# Preexisting markov models

- **GIR% (Greens in regulation)** — percentage of holes played where you land the ball on the green with at least two strokes left on par.
    - Generally, the higher the GIR% → the higher your average score in a round.
- **Total putting** — computed using the distances at which putts are attempted, and how often.
    - Lower total putting statistic equates to being a better putter.
    - Generally, the lower the total putting → the higher your average score in a round.

## DFS Companies

- Companies that consult others on DFS.
- Below is an example markov chain that a top DFS company uses to project the fantasy points.

# New model refinements

![Untitled 4 166.png](attachments/Untitled%204%20166.png)

- For each of the areas on the golf course, we can layerize the areas.
    - On the fairway, it’s better to be 50 yards out than 100 yards out.

## Better statistics

- The two statistics used for this new model are:
    - Baseline _B(d, s)_ — the expected number of strokes for an average PGA Tour player required to complete the hole from _d_ yards on surface type _s_.
        - E.g. B(200 yd, fairway) is approximately 3.4 or 3.5 strokes.
    - Strokes gained (SG) measures how “good” each individual shot is.
        - We can use this to predict what the player’s score will be.

- The intermediate baselines all cancel out, so we can calculate the total strokes gained.
    - If we have an idea of strokes gained for each player, and
- Total strokes gained is defined as:
    
    `SG:total = SG:long + SG:medium + SG:short + SG:putt`
