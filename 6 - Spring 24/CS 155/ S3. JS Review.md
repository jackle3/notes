# General stuff

- **Inline print:** ``**console.log(`Hello ${variable}`);**``
- **Equals:**
    - `==` only checks the value → checks truthy/falsy
    - `===` checks the type **and** value → use this most of the time.
- **Arrays:** `**let myHobbies = ["reading", "music", "traveling"]**`
- **Objects:**
    
    ```JavaScript
    let car = {
    	"make" : "ford",
    	"model" : "f150",
    	"year" : 2016
    }
    
    // need to stringify in order to print
    console.log(JSON.stringify(car));
    ```
    
- **Spread operator:**
    
    ```JavaScript
    function sum(x, y, z, a = 0) {
    	return x + y + z + a;
    }
    
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    
    // same as sum(numbers[0], numbers[1], numbers[2])
    console.log(sum(...numbers)); // 6
    
    // also useful to add new numbers
    const newNums = [...numbers, 7];
    console.log(newNums) // [1, 2, 3, 7]
    
    // can also use it to construct objects from arrays
    let myHobbies = ["reading", "music", "traveling"]
    let hObject = {...myHobbies};
    console.log(hObject); // { '0': 'reading', '1': 'music', '2': 'traveling' }
    ```
    
- **Variables:**
    - var → globally scoped
    - let → regular variable, well-defined function/local scope
    - const → same as let, but variable can’t change
- **For-loops:**
    
    ```JavaScript
    let myHobbies = ["reading", "music", "traveling"]
    
    for (let x in myHobbies) {
    	console.log(x); // prints indices -> 0, 1, 2
    }
    
    for (let x of myHobbies) {
    	console.log(x); // prints values -> reading, music, traveling
    }
    
    for (let x = 0; x < 3; x++) {
    	console.log(x); // prints 0, 1, 2
    }
    ```
    
- **Functions:**
    
    ```JavaScript
    // regular function notation
    function square(a) {
    	return a**2;
    }
    
    // arrow function
    const square = (a) => {
    	return a**2;
    }
    
    // arrow function without curly braces
    const square = (a) => a**2;
    ```
    
- **Classes:**
    
    ```JavaScript
    class Rectangle {
    	constructor(height, width) {
    		this.height = height;
    		this.width = width;
    	}
    	
    	// getter
    	get area() {
    		return this.calcArea();
    	}
    	
    	// method
    	calcArea() {
    		return this.height * this.width;
    	}
    }
    ```
    
- **Closures:**
    
    - The outer variable `name` is accessible from the inner function `displayName`

# Async stuff

- **Callback functions:**
    
    - Typically used for asynchronous functions → a function that runs after finishing the first function.
    
    ```JavaScript
    // Example: a takes in another function and calls it
    let a = (func) => {
    	func("foo");
    }
    
    a(console.log);
    
    // Example: callback used for async
    fs.readFile(`example.txt`,
    	// this function is run after reading the file (callback)
    	function(err, data) {
    		if (err) {
    			console.error("Error reading file");
    			return;
    		}
    		console.log("File read successfully:", data);
    	}
    );
    ```
    

## Promises

- Promise: I’m going to do an async operation → after a certain amount of time, we will resolve it or print out an error.
    - In this example, the promise **resolves** after 300 milliseconds.
        
        - We can change the `resolve` to `reject` to have it reject after 300 milliseconds.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 1 42.png|Untitled 1 42.png]]
        
    - The `then` means the code is only executed **upon resolution of the promise.**

  

- **Not waiting on promise:**
    
    - This example, it prints `Promise { <pending> }`, then it prints `foo`
        - This is because we did `console.log(promiseFunction())` → it doesn’t print `foo` because foo is only returned after 300 milliseconds.

- **Callback hell** → we can have nested callback functions

- **Async/await →** primary method of interacting with asynchronous operations.
    
    - In the `asyncCall` function…
        1. It immediately runs the `console.log('calling')` line.
        2. Then, it waits for the Promise to resolve from `resolveAfter2Seconds`
        3. Then, it logs the `result`.

- **Trap with async/await:**
    - This function simply prints out `Promise { <pending> }` because the last `console.log` does not have an await on it.
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 5 41.png|Untitled 5 41.png]]
        
    - The version below prints out `Promise { <pending> }` then prints out `resolved.
        
        - Again, the bottom `console.log` prints out the promise.
        - Then, the log inside the function prints `resolved`.

# Cloud Isolation

- Suppose you are making a web app that supports pictures, and you want to use the ImageMagick library to take care of the image editing functionalities.
    
    - However, ImageMagick might have bugs → you want to use it without incurring the risks.

## Isolation Option 1: Processes

- You can run ImageMagick in a separate process → air gap between resources.

## Isolation Option 2: Containers

- You can use Docker or hypervisors to isolate the processes on the same hardware.
    - Docker isolates apps/containers on one host OS.
    - Hypervisors isolates multiple VMs with their own OS.

## Process Privilege Reduction Through Containers

## Isolation at the Cloud Infrastructure Level (AWS)

- Resources are not shared → dynamic

![[attachments/Untitled 11 38.png|Untitled 11 38.png]]

- Makes sure that everyone only has the privileges necessary for regular operations.
