# Session Cookies

- HTTP is a stateless protocol.
- Cookies allow the server to know who its interacting with when using HTTP.

- This might be bad because the cookie can be hijacked.
    - Attacker can modify the cookie before sending it back.

## Cookie SOP

## DOM SOP

![Untitled 5 48.png](attachments/Untitled%205%2048.png)

## DOM vs Cookie SOP

- The two sites have different Cookie origins, but same DOM origins.
    - This allows one site to read the DOM of the other.
    - The DOM SOP overrides the Cookie SOP

# CORS

- This is a safe way to access information from other websites â†’ make sure the application has permission before sending the actual request.

# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

![Untitled 8 47.png](attachments/Untitled%208%2047.png)

## Reflected XSS

- In this case, the user trusts the website.
    - They click on a link to the website (but the URL has some script tags)
    - If the website does not properly sanitize the URL, the script tags get injected and executed.

## Stored XSS

- This would be like the attacker putting a script into their profile.
    - When the user clicks on their profile, they are infected.

## XSS Defenses - CSP

![Untitled 11 45.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%2045.png)

- CSP basically says: only load these sources, assets, and scripts based on rules that we define ourselves.
    - Recall in the reflected XSS example, the src in the script was different from the site.
    - With CSP, we can make it so scripts are not loaded from any site except my own.

# Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

![Untitled 13 43.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%2043.png)

- Supose the bank purely uses the cookie for validation on a form.
    - Suppose User A logs in to `bank` and has their cookie validated.
    - Then Attacker sends a link that, when User A clicks it, sends a request to transfer from `bank`.
    - `bank` thinks that User A made that request, so it makes the fund transfer, without User A knowing.

## Defenses

# SQL Injection

- Occurs when we use unsanitized user input for SQL commands.
