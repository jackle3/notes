# Project Overview

- Part 1 & Part 2:
    - Use **nmap** and **Wireshark** to perform and analyze port scans
- Part 3:
    - Write a Go program to **detect port scanning/ARP** spoofing from network traffic
- Part 4:
    - Implement a **DNS spoofer/MITM** in Go to hijack HTTP connection

# Part 1

- Nmap (Network Mapper) is a **port scanner**
    - Sends raw IP packets to detect hosts, find open ports, etc.
- Used in network exploration, host discovery, and security auditing
- For faster completion time to test your nmap flag selection/Wireshark setup, try running nmap command with a limited selection of ports first
    - Scanning all ports can take ~30 minutes on Stanford’s network because of its rate limiting of nmap scans

  

## nmap

- We will be scanning [scanme.nmap.org](http://scanme.nmap.org) → explicit permission to scan.
    - We need to read the docs to determine what flags to use for the specifications.

  

- We can do a basic scan by using `nmap scanme.nmap.org`
    
    ```JavaScript
    Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-05-27 15:01 PDT
    Nmap scan report for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)
    Host is up (0.0063s latency).
    
    Not shown: 992 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
    PORT      STATE    SERVICE
    22/tcp    open     ssh
    25/tcp    filtered smtp
    80/tcp    open     http
    135/tcp   filtered msrpc
    139/tcp   filtered netbios-ssn
    445/tcp   filtered microsoft-ds
    9929/tcp  open     nping-echo
    31337/tcp open     Elite
    
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.39 seconds
    ```
    

  

- We can do a more in depth scan with `sudo nmap -sS -A -T4` `[scanme.nmap.org](http://scanme.nmap.org/)`

- These results tell us what ports are closed, open, or filtered.

# Part 2

- Wireshark is a **packet sniffer**
    - View, log, and analyse packets traveling through network interfaces
- Use display filters in top command line to only show certain entries
    - Can specify things like ip address, port
- Make sure to start your capture before running nmap command from part 1!

  

## Wireshark

- We will use Wireshark to examine the traffic generated by nmap during Part 1.
    - We can also use it to debug in later parts of the assignment.

  

- To start a capture, click on the **blue fin icon** in the top left corner.
    - There will be a ton of things going in and out already.
    - We should start the capture before we run nmap.

  

- To stop a capture, click on the **red square icon** in the top left corner.

  

- To filter, we can use the bar at the top.
    
    - Once we know the desired IP address and port, we can filter based on that.

- During port scanning, if we scan a port that is closed, it will show two packets:

# Part 3

- Given a pcap (packet capture) file, detect port scanning and ARP spoofing
- You will be working in `detector.go` → there is a lot of starter code and comments

## Port Scanning

![Untitled 2 57.png](attachments/Untitled%202%2057.png)

- Our definition of an unauthorized scanner that we want to report on is:
    - An IP addresses that…
        - sent >3x SYN packets as the number of SYN+ACK replies they received
        - sent more than 5 SYN packets in total
    - In other words, they’re sending a lot of information and not receiving much back.

  

## ARP Spoofing

![Untitled 3 57.png](attachments/Untitled%203%2057.png)

- Our definition of an ARP spoofer that we want to report on is:
    - MAC addresses that sent more than 5 unsolicited ARP replies
- Unsolicited ARP replies **contain a source IP and destination MAC address** combination that **does not correspond to a previous request**
    - In other words, each request should correspond to at most one reply, and any extra replies are unsolicited

  

## Introduction to Go

- Open-source project created by Google
- Goals:
    - Static typing and runtime efficiency (like C)
    - Readability and usability (like Python or JavaScript)
    - High-performance networking and multiprocessing
- In practice: Syntactically similar to C, but with additional features
    - memory safety, garbage collection, type inference, built-in concurrency primitives, etc.
- Alternative memory safe programming language: Rust
    - faster performance (similar to C)
    - much higher learning curve

  

## Other Notes

- Getting started:
    - Read through the starter code for `detector.go`!
    - Many hints at bottom with specific links to helpful pieces of documentation.
- Your task:
    - Develop a Go program (`detector.go`) that takes in a PCAP file and detects possible SYN scans and ARP spoofing attacks.
    - Fill in TODOs/unfinished sections.
- Testing:
    - Download sample `sample.pcap` file from testing section of Project 3 handout
        - Expand the compressed file and move it to Part 3 folder for testing

  

# Part 4

![Untitled 4 56.png](attachments/Untitled%204%2056.png)

  

- Goal: Implement an MITM program in Go (`mitm.go`) to hijack HTTP connection.
    - You will perform three steps.
        1. ARP Spoof
            
            > “Hey, we are the DNS server you are looking for”
            
        2. DNS Spoof
            
            > “Since we’re the DNS server, here is the totally real IP address associated with the hostname you’re looking for”
            
        3. HTTP attack to steal credentials and other requirements
            
            > Once you’ve spoofed, you accept a connection from the victim and forward/proxy all requests to and from the server.
            

  

## MITM Attack (ARP Spoofing)

- Spoof an ARP response to fool the user into using the attacker’s device as a DNS server.
    - Vulnerable because ARP is not authenticated. This means that anyone on a local network can claim to have any IP address.

  

- In the example below, the client broadcasts an ARP request.
    - The attacker replies faster than the real DNS server → lies about the IP.

![Untitled 5 56.png](attachments/Untitled%205%2056.png)

  

## MITM Attack (DNS Spoofing)

- Send a spoofed DNS response to trick the user into associating the hostname [fakebank.com](http://fakebank.com/) with the attacker’s IP address instead of its real address.
    - Vulnerable because DNS is also not authenticated

  

- Once you’ve performed the ARP spoof, it’s much easier to do a DNS spoof.
    - Once they are ARP spoofed, the client will now communicate solely with the attacker.
    - The attacker can control the DNS response.
    - The client does not actually talk with the real DNS server, because they think Attacker is the real server.

![Untitled 6 55.png](attachments/Untitled%206%2055.png)

  

## MITM Attack (HTTP Attack)

- Accept a connection from the victim and forward all HTTP requests to and from [fakebank.com](http://fakebank.com/)’s server.
    - Vulnerable because HTTP is unencrypted and unauthenticated so a network eavesdropper can view and modify any http communication.

  

- Here, the attacker just forwards all the clients to the real site. It also forwards the response to the client.
    - This allows the attacker to modify and eavesdrop anything.
