# Stack Frames

- %rsp, %rbp, etc — 64 bit/8 byte CPU registers

- Frames get added in direction of lower addresses → stack grows down.
    - When a function is called, a stack frame is added.
    - When a function returns, the stack frame gets “popped” off.
- RBP = base pointer (points to previous frame’s base pointer → callee’s base pointer)
    - Local variables are often accessed relative to RBP.
    - “base” of the stack space a function has to work with.
- RSP = stack pointer (points to lowest address in the stack)
- args = parameters to function
- Return address = memory address of instruction to return to after this function finishes.

# Adding frame

- Notice that the RBP of `main` is saved in the stack frame of the lower function.

# Buffer overflow

![Untitled 9 48.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2048.png)

- `strcpy` is vulnerable because it can copy unlimited → easy to overflow past buffer.# xpl

# Other attacks

- Note that we are overflowing the buffer in `foo`, since that is where `buf` is created.

![Untitled 12 47.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%2047.png)

- The buffer is 256. We want to overwrite the buffer and the RA and the RBP.
    - As such, the exploit needs to be 256 + 8 + 8 = 272.
- We want the address of the buffer to be the new RA.
    - Go into GDB and print out the address of the buffer.
