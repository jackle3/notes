# Mobile Threat Model
* It has unique concerns from desktop security!
* **Similarities**:
	1. You can steal data from it
	2. You can use it as a botnet
* **Differences**: 
	1. Your phone contains uniquely sensitive information, like your location 
	2. It has your 2FA codes 
	3. Multiple people may have access to your phone

## Defense: passcodes
* We enter short passcodes to get into our iPhones
* Why can’t an attacker try all of the passcodes?
	1. The phone uses a slow hash function
		* Normal hash functions can compute anywhere between thousands to millions of hashes per second
		* Phones hash functions takes 80 ms to check a single passcode
	2. It processes the passcode in a **secure enclave**
	3. A special **encrypt** function is used, which implements rate limits
		* The enclave contains a **hardware key** (`K_uid`)
		* The encrypt function generates a **class key** by computing `encrypt(K_uid, passcode)`
		* A wrong passcode will generate a wrong class key.

## Defense: secure boot

## Defense: device downgrade prevention

* System Software Authorization
	* OS updates for each phone receives a *device-personalized signature*
	* To downgrade a phone, an attacker needs the signature.
		* I.e. must have recorded the device-specific OS update when it previously occurred

## Defense: app communication

* Implicit intents:
	1. Specify an action and/or data
	2. Android will wake up apps that can handle that action

* Be careful of implicit intents!
	* Malicious apps can wake up.

## Defense: permissions
* Prompts
	* Time of use
	* Could cause alert fatigue
* Manifests
	* Approve all capabilities at install time
	* User has no context
	
* **General alert design principles**
	1. Specify risks and explain how the user should make decisions
	2. Make the default option the safe one
	3. If a system can make the decision for someone, it should

## Defense: logging
* Old versions of Android gave other apps access to each others’ log files
* Be careful of what you log!
* Never do something like `Log.V(“Debug”, user_info.password)`


# Network defense
* **On path**: the attacker can read, drop, manipulate traffic
* **Off path**: the attacker can spoof traffic, but cannot read your traffic

* The best network defense is to use a secure communication protocol like TLS or SSH.

* DNSSEC: Sign DNS responses
	1. No privacy
	2. We still need to protect the actual traffic to the website

* RPKI: Each AS signs which IP range they own (i.e. Stanford says that they own IPs A through B)
	1. Attackers can still insert themselves to legitimate BGP paths
	2. Attackers can copy the legit advertisements

## Firewalls
* We want to keep certain services and information *private from the public*
* **Packet filtering:** rules that limit what types of packets can enter or leave a network
* **Stateful filtering:** track outbound traffic and allow associated inbound traffic 
* **Host firewall:** firewall rules for individual hosts 
* **NGFW:** These firewalls can inspect higher level issues (e.g. application level)
* **TLS inspection:** Many organizations install their own root CAs, so they can inspect TLS traffic


# DOS
* DOS Bugs: Exploit protocol asymmetry
* DOS Floods: Control a large number of bots


## DOS Bugs (Syn Flood)
1. When a server receives SYN, it needs to track some state to remember the partial connection
2. An attacker can send a server many messages containing SYN

* **Solution?** SYN cookies


## DNS Amplification
* Spoof source IP (set it to victim's) to spam victim with traffic.
* Common applications:
	* Use the DNS "any" query
	* Use NTP

## DNS Floods
* Mirai botnet -> logged in to many devices using default passwords

## DOS Defenses
* Ingress filtering
* Using TLS
