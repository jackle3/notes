# Recap: CSRF Attack

![Untitled 73.png](attachments/Untitled%2073.png)

## Preventing CSRF Attacks

- TLDR: Never trust cookies to indicate whether a request is authorized.
    - Don’t depend on the referer header since it’s kind of antiquated.
- If an endpoint is used for form submissions, include **CSRF tokens** to ensure that the form came from the right place.
- If you are making requests through JS, add the custom HTTP header to force the CORS pre-flight check.

## GET Requests

![Untitled 2 40.png](attachments/Untitled%202%2040.png)

## sameSite Cookies

![Untitled 3 40.png](attachments/Untitled%203%2040.png)

- **sameSite** Cookies have two modes:
    
    ![Untitled 4 39.png](attachments/Untitled%204%2039.png)
    
    - E.g. suppose you go to [`bofa.com`](http://bofa.com) from `google.com`. If you use strict mode, the cookie for `bofa` will not be sent, so you won’t be logged in.
        - Lax Mode allows top-level navigations (clicking on a link), while preventing other requests like form submissions from other domains.

## Properly Secured Cookie

# Recap: XSS Attack

- SQL Injection: directly using the user content in a SQL command without validatino.
- XSS: attacker uploads code (e.g. HTML) that gets executed when the victim loads the attacker’s page.

![Untitled 6 38.png](attachments/Untitled%206%2038.png)

- To secure against this, just assume that any user input is malicious → need validation.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

![Untitled 7 38.png](attachments/Untitled%207%2038.png)

![Untitled 8 38.png](attachments/Untitled%208%2038.png)

# Clickjacking Attacks

- In HTML code:
    - We can have frames that overlap one another.
    - We can also make a frame invisible from the user.
- Using this, we can place an invisible frame over an existing frame.
    - When the user tries to click on the lower page, they actually click the transparent frame.

![Untitled 9 37.png](attachments/Untitled%209%2037.png)

## Incorrect solution: framebusting

- If you find yourself in a frame, try to get out → in practice, parent can intercept.

![Untitled 10 36.png](attachments/Untitled%2010%2036.png)

## Correct solution: CSP

- We can use CSPs to tell the browser: “don’t ever stuff me in a frame”.

![Untitled 11 36.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%2036.png)

# Third-Party Content Safety

- Recall that when you load JS from elsewhere, it will execute as the person who loaded it.
    - If [`bank.com`](http://bank.com) loads JS from `jquery`, that code will run as if it were `bank.com`

![Untitled 12 36.png](attachments/Untitled%2012%2036.png)

- By downloading a third-party script, we can increase security but lose performance.
    - We like to load third party services because it makes our website faster → if we had to manually download the script each time (for every site), that’s very slow.

## Sub-Resource Integrity (SRI)

- Many companies will give you the hash of the file in order to compare and confirm the integrity of the file.

![Untitled 13 35.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%2035.png)

![Untitled 14 33.png](attachments/Untitled%2014%2033.png)

- We can enforce SRI using CSPs.
    
    ![Untitled 15 31.png](attachments/Untitled%2015%2031.png)
    

# Securely Using Cookies

- Cookies can easily be compromised → users can modify cookie and cookie header.

![Untitled 16 31.png](attachments/Untitled%2016%2031.png)

## Signing Cookies

- If we use cookies to store information, we can generate a tag to ensure integrity.
    - When we set the cookie, we set the value with the tag.
        - The tag is signed including the value of the cookie.
    - When we receive the cookie, we can verify the tag.
        - If it’s changed, then the cookie value (or smth else) changed.
- In practice, you probably don’t want to do this because you need to sign every cookie.
    - It’d be better to set a unique opaque session identifier for the user.

![Untitled 17 28.png](attachments/Untitled%2017%2028.png)

# Authentication and Session Management

## HTTP Auth

- This is a very old scheme → seen in routers, old websites, etc.
- When you log into a website, it shows a browser login popup.

![Untitled 18 26.png](attachments/Untitled%2018%2026.png)

- How it works is:
    - You make a GET request to the server.
    - The server responds witih a header including **WWW-Authenticate**
    - When the browser receives this header, it popups the login dialogue.
    - Once you enter your information, the browser sends that back to the server in another request.
        - It passes it in using the **Authorization** header → base64 encoding of username and password (or hash of password)
- This is not used in commercial sites. The **problems are:**
    - Users cannot log out unless they close their browser.
        - Once you log in, the browser will always send that header.
    - The site cannot customize the password dialog → no forgot password option.
    - Confusing dialog to users.
    - Can easily be spoofed.

# Session Management Today

- The first time you visit a website, it will give you a session identifier.
    - Every request you make on the website now includes this identifier → allows website to track the anonymous user without being logged in.
- When you try to log in, the server will give you a form.
    - This form will have the CSRF token (most likely will be linked to the session identifier)
- Once you log in, it simply updates the state in the backhand.
    - **The cookie and session identifier does not change**, even after you log in.

![Untitled 19 23.png](attachments/Untitled%2019%2023.png)

## Session Token/Identifier

- The session token should be long, random, opaque, and not predictable or manipulatable.

![Untitled 20 23.png](attachments/Untitled%2020%2023.png)

## Implementing Logout

- We need to delete the **SessionToken cookie** from the user’s machine.
- We also need to mark the sesssion token as expired on the backend.
    - If the user’s token was stolen, this prevents others from using that token after the user has logged out.

# Authenticating Users

1. **Plain Text Passwords (Terrible)**
    1. Store the actual password and check match against user input.
    2. This is terrible design → if the database is compromised, all passwords are stolen.
        1. Tip: Don’t trust any service that can provide you your password.
2. **Store Password Hash (Bad)**
    1. Store SHA-1 (of your pw) and check match against SHA-1 (of the input).
        
        1. Hash Function: output is unpredictable based on input, and you can’t figure out input based on output.
        
        ![Untitled 23 15.png](attachments/Untitled%2023%2015.png)
        
    2. Protects against database compromise → attacker can’t know password.
        1. Weak against attacker who has hashed common passwords because hash functions are public.
3. **Store Salted Hash (Best)**
    
    1. We hash the password `pw` concatenated with the salt `r` (salt is user-specific)
        1. When someone tries to log in, you get the salt `r` from the database, and then check the hash.
    2. Store `**(r, Hash(pw||r))**` and check against `**Hash(input||r)**`
    3. **Salt:** a long and random sequence that’s concatenated to the pasword before hasing.
        1. Even if everyone used the same password, they would have a unique hash.
        2. Prevents attackers from pre-computing password hashes
    4. Make sure to choose a hash function that’s expensive to compute.
        1. The speed of hash functions don’t really matter for the user experience.
        2. Using a fast hash function makes it harder for attackers to brute force the hash.
            1. The standard is hash function is BCrypt → its “slow” on all platforms

## Password Requirements

![Untitled 25 11.png](attachments/Untitled%2025%2011.png)

- If you tell people to make password more complex, they usually do so in predictable ways
- Requiring users to regularly change passwords leads to people using the same passwords but weaker.
- **Length is the most important factor.**

![Untitled 26 10.png](attachments/Untitled%2026%2010.png)

## Designing Login Workflows

- Don’t let the error message leak information to the attacker.

![Untitled 27 9.png](attachments/Untitled%2027%209.png)

## Preventing Guessing

![Untitled 28 8.png](attachments/Untitled%2028%208.png)

## What do passwords protect against?

![Untitled 29 8.png](attachments/Untitled%2029%208.png)

# Phishing

![Untitled 30 8.png](attachments/Untitled%2030%208.png)

## Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)

![Untitled 31 7.png](attachments/Untitled%2031%207.png)

  

- This system can be abused: **IDN homograph attack**

![Untitled 32 7.png](attachments/Untitled%2032%207.png)

  

- The site below looks legit, but it is not actually [`apple.com`](http://apple.com)
    - Users are usually trained to look at the link, and this link looks pretty right.
    - Fortunately, browsers like Chrome prevent against this.

![Untitled 33 7.png](attachments/Untitled%2033%207.png)

![Untitled 34 6.png](attachments/Untitled%2034%206.png)

  

## Google Safe Browsing

- Google has a huge databse of Phising and Malware websites to protect the user.
    - This is great → though the database is always a little out of date.
- An easy way to implement this is to send and validate every URL a user visits with Google.
    - This is **terrible privacy →** Google sees all user traffic.

![Untitled 35 6.png](attachments/Untitled%2035%206.png)

  

- This is how the safe browsing service actually works:
    
    1. When Chrome starts, it goes to Google’s SBS and asks for the prefixes of the hashes of malicious URLs.
    
    ![Untitled 36 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2036%205.png)
    
      
    
    1. When you visit a website, it calculates the hash of the combinations of
        1. subdomain + no path
        2. parent domain + no path
        3. subdomain + path
        4. parent domain + path.
    
    ![Untitled 37 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2037%205.png)
    
      
    
    1. You then go to your database, and check if any of the hashes you calculated are contained in the table of prefixes.
    
    ![Untitled 38 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2038%205.png)
    
      
    
    1. If the database answers yes, then you send a request to the SBS to check for exact hash matches.
    
    ![Untitled 39 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2039%205.png)
    

  

- This method does not really leak anything to Google.
    - The only time Google’s SBS might know what site you visit is when you ask for the prefix match → even then, there can be millions of sites with this prefix.

# MFA

- No matter how good your password is, if you get phished, then you are pwned.
    
    ![Untitled 40 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2040%205.png)
    

  

- MFA provides something _other than the password_ to authenticate into an account.
    - This protects against credential stuffing (copy passwords from beach) and phishing

![Untitled 41 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2041%204.png)

  

## SMS-Based Two Factor

- If someone stole your username and password, but doesn’t have your SMS messages, they can’t log into your account.
- This does not protect against:
    - Phishing attacks
        1. The phishing site takes the user-entered username and password.
        2. They submit that username and password to the legitimate website.
        3. The legitimate website asks for the 2FA code.
        4. The phising site shows the same alert box to the user.
        5. The user, trusting that the phishing site is real, submits the 2FA code.
        6. The phishing site sends it to the legit website.
        7. User is pwned.
    - SIM swapping
        - It’s really easy to get a mobile carrier to give your phone number to someone else.
    - Social Engineering

![Untitled 42 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2042%204.png)

  

## Six-Digit Authentication Apps

- How does it work?
    - The QR code tells your app to create a private/public key pair.
    - Your device takes this, combines with the time window, and hashes a secret passcode.
    - The server does the same, and compares the passcodes.
- This protects against SIM swapping, but not the others.

![Untitled 43 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2043%204.png)

  

## Duo Push Notifications

- Still does not fully prevent phishing.
    - The attacker can still invoke the request to get the Duo push notification.
    - **Added security: now shows the location of the request.**
        - Now depending on the user to be attentive enough to see the location and local time.

![Untitled 44 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2044%204.png)

  

## How to provide foolproof 2FA

- We need some form of 2FA that **does not depend** on the user knowing that they are talking to the right website or not.
    - Most secure solutions rely on **cryptographic operation that’s tied to the website** being visited by the user
    - We have fool-proof solutions today: physical security tokens and Passkeys

  

### Physical Tokens

- Each of these hardware tokens has a public and private key pair.
    - E.g. Yubikey
- The private key can’t be extracted from the hardware device (without destroying device)
- When you click the button, the Yubikey will use the **private key to sign** whatever challenge the computer is asking.

![Untitled 45 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2045%204.png)

  

### U2F Protocol

![Untitled 46 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2046%204.png)

- How it works:
    1. Server comes up with some **challenge** (e.g. some large random number).
    2. The server **sends that challenge** to the browser.
    3. The browser then speaks over **USB to the Yubikey.**
    4. The Yubikey **signs the challenge** and sends the signature back to the browser.
    5. The browser sends the **signature and challenge** back to the server.
- This protects against phishing.
    - The info sent to the Yubikey includes the **origin (the domain of the webserver that gave the challenge)** and the **channel id**.
        - E.g. if you visit [`attacker.com`](http://attacker.com) and it gives you a challenge, the Yubikey will sign the challenge and `attacker.com`.
    - The server can then verify if the origin and channel id are correct.

  

### FIDO2/WebAuthN

- Basically like U2F (YubiKey), but not just for second factor
- Allows you to fully login with a hardware token (e.g. fingerprint, face, etc)
- Most modern devices have a separate, secure code processor that reads the fingerprint to authenticate.
    - Cryptographic operation provided by the hardware of the device.

![Untitled 47 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2047%204.png)

  

### Pass Keys

- Pretty much the same as FIDO/WebAuthN, but there is now a separate synchronization mechanism where Google can pass the public/private key pair between your devices.

# Building a Secure Web Application

![Untitled 49 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2049%204.png)

![Untitled 50 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2050%203.png)

  

- There is a lot of documentation from Mozilla that tells you how to set up the CSP.
