# Privacy

## Definitions
* Privacy is **control over your own information.**
	* Freedom from intrusion into personal matters
* Privacy is a person’s right or expectation to control the disclosure of his/her personal information, including activity metadata
* Privacy is the “right to be let alone” — Louis Brandeis
* Privacy means something like what the Founders meant by “liberty”
	* Free speech, free association, autonomy, freedom from censorship and constant surveillance
* Privacy-motivating examples in U.S. History
	* Martin Luther King Jr. “blackmailed” by FBI
	* McCarthyism witch-hunt for communists

## Security
* You can have security **without privacy**...
	* E.g. Verizon can ensure that your communication is encrypted and secure, but they could then sell your information (still securely).
* But not privacy without security.
	* E.g. If Verizon gets owned (security failure), customer information can be leaked (loss of privacy).

## HTTPS

* One of the best ways to maintain privacy is to encourage the adoption of HTTPS.

* Google is at forefront of HTTPS adoption by locking features (and ranking results) based on whether it was HTTPS or HTTP.

* Today, most web traffic loads over HTTPS.


# Third Party Cookie

* When you load a site like the one below:
	* It loads the Facebook share image directly *from Facebook*
	* Since you loaded something from FB, *they can set a cookie on your machine.*
	![Pasted image 20240609214400](Pasted%20image%2020240609214400.png)

* **First Party Cookie:** cookies set by the site you are visiting.
* **Third Party Cookie:** cookies set by sites where resources are loaded from, but you are not actually visiting it.


## Example
* In the example below:
	* You visit CNN -> CNN sets a *first party cookie*
	* CNN loads resources from Google -> Google sets a *third party cookie*
	* Then suppose you visit Reddit.
		* If Reddit loads something from Google, the cookie that was set on CNN will be sent.
		* **Issue:** Google now knows that you went to CNN then Reddit.

## Referer Field
* In the example above
	* Google will set a Cookie ID, which allows them to track you.
	* They can also see the Referer field.

* The Referer field is *designed to stop CSRF attacks* -> identify where people are visiting from (makes sure request to `bank.com` comes from visiting `bank.com`)

* However, it also *leaks a lot of information*

* Example:
	* Suppose you go to CNN.
	* Then, CNN loads a resource from Facebook.
		* The Referer for this request will be `cnn.com`
	![Pasted image 20240609215053](Pasted%20image%2020240609215053.png)


* **What is sent in the Referer field?**
	* This depends on the browser!
	* Some browsers only send the origin -> visiting `site.com/path` only shows `site.com` in field
	* Others send the full URL (including query parameters) -> visiting `site.com/path?query` shows the full thing in field.

* The **worst case** is if the full URL you are on is sent to every site that you load a resource from.

## Tracking

* Facebook, DoubleClick (Google), etc. know much more about you than the actual website you visit does *because they can track you across websites.*

![Pasted image 20240609215542](Pasted%20image%2020240609215542.png)

* In the top 1 million sites:
	* Facebook has something that can track you in 33% of sites.
	* Google has something that can track you in 67.8% of of sites.

* This is how companies create *targeted ads*
	* Third-party tracking is how companies create ad-revenue.

## Solutions
* There are applications such as `Ghostery` or `Do Not Track` that prevent trackers -> does not work that well.
	* `Ghostery` can block legit cookies and trackers, breaking websites.
	* `Do Not Track` allowed users to tell ad providers to not track you -> failed because advertisers just ignored it.

* In recent years, browsers are blocking third-party cookies -> prevents tracking
	* **Firefox**
		* Third-Party Cookies from known trackers are dropped
		* Alternatively, third-party cookies use separate cookie jars *per site*
			* A third-party cookie loaded from CNN is only sent if you visit CNN.
			* Prevents them being used to track users across sites
	* **Safari**
		* Blocks third-party cookies
	* **IE:**
		* Blocks some third-party cookies based on baked-in blacklist
	* **Edge** does not block third-party cookies by default
	* **Chrome** announced that they will drop support for third party cookies by  the end of 2024


# Web Tracking

* Cookies are a great way of tracking people, but people can clear their cookies.

* There has been work to fingerprint the browser itself -> can't really clear this information.

	* **Browser fingerprinting** ->  technique that leverages all your settings to identify you, and stores this in a cookie on your browser
		* E.g. fingerprints the browser using screen size, battery percentage, permissions, user agent, etc (most are accessible via JS)

	* So long as JavaScript can run (by third-parties), you run the risk of being “followed” on the web

## Incognito Mode

* In most browsers, incognito mode...
	* Uses a fresh cookie jar (no tracking)
	* Does not have any extensions
	* All caches of data (that can be fingerprinted) are cleared for you.

* It basically makes you look like the first time you installed the browser.
	* Prevents you from being tracked across websites by features in the web session

* However, it does not prevent you from *passive eavesdropping*
	* An HTTP request from normal Chrome vs. incognito mode is treated as the exact same by the network.
	* If someone is a middleman (e.g. landlord owns the access point), they can still **see the network metadata**. 
		* Even if you connect over TLS, they can maybe see the list of possible sites you accessed using the SNI.
	* They don't know the content, but they know who you are connecting with.

## Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

* PETs are methods for **protecting personal data**
* Most Common/Successful? TLS.

* Comes with browser; works without you configuring anything.
	* **Protects contents of communication** from passive eavesdroppers and active MITM attacks

* Tools that provide **confidentiality also provide some privacy**.
	* You probably don't want your landlord or coffee shop customers to learn things about you


# Protecting Metadata

* **TLS only protects content.** It does not protect against metadata or provide anonymity.
	* E.g. IP header content like destination and source IP is unencrypted. If someone knows the IP, they know who you are connecting to.

* Metadata includes things like: Who is visiting what websites? Who is sending messages to whom? 

* This is important because...
	* Gov’t might not like that you’re visiting Human Rights Watch website
	* Gov’t might not be amused that you’re sending messages to Human Rights Watch

* We may want to **hide the existence of the message** (maybe sending an encrypted message at all is going to cause you problems)

# Anonymity

* A **person is not identifiable** within a set of people accessing that site.

* *Anonymity requires*:
	* **Unlinkability** of action and identity
		* For example, sender and his email are no more related after adversary’s observations than they were before
		* Who talks to whom
	* **Unobservability**
		* Adversary cannot tell whether someone is using a particular system and/or protocol

* We want anonymity because...
	* To protect privacy
	* Protection from prosecution
	* To prevent chilling-effects

* However, **anonymity is hard** with the current design.
	* The `src IP` and `dst IP` are in plaintext in every packet.
	* ISPs often store communication records (who you connect to), and law enforcements can subpoena these.
	* Wireless traffic can be intercepted.

* Anonymity is **difficult to achieve on your own**.
	* **Solution:** ask someone else to send it for you.

## Naive Solution: VPNs

* You can pay a VPN to be your intermediary.
	* You send all your traffic to the VPN, the VPN forwards that, and then sends it all back to you.

* This protects you against the ISP -> they can only see that you connected to the VPN.

* **Issue:** you've basically just moved your trust to the VPNs.
	* VPNs can fully see everything you do. You are anonymous to the ISP, but not the VPN.
	* Many VPNs store your records, which can be subpoenaed.

* *Never trust VPNs when they say they're not storing your records.*

## Actual Solution: TORs

* This is the state of the art if you actually want anonymity on the internet.

* Tor is a successful *privacy enhancing technology* that works at the *transport layer* (with millions of active users)
	* Normally, a TCP connection reveals your IP address
	* Tor allows TCP connections without revealing your IP

* It works by *tunneling traffic through multiple “onion routers”* using public key cryptography.
	* Everyone in the network is a volunteer.
	![Pasted image 20240609223143](Pasted%20image%2020240609223143.png)


### Entry/Guard Relays
* The **Entry guard / guard relay** is the node that the client enters the Tor network from.
	* Since the entry guard knows who the client is, usually *clients pick a very trusted person/relay* as the entry guard.

* **Issue:** How do you protect against an adversary creating a large number of onion  routers and performing timing observation at entrance and exits?
* **Solution:** Limit the servers used for initial connection to a subset of trusted nodes:
	* Have long and consistent uptimes… 
	* Have high bandwidth… 
	* Are manually vetted by the Tor community
* Tor client selects 3 guard relays and uses them for 3 months

### Exit Nodes
* The **Exit node** is the node where traffic exits the Tor network and goes to the destination.
	* The exit node does not know or control any traffic that goes through and leaves from it.
	* Exit nodes are risky because traffic is associated with your IP.
	* As such, they're usually run by nonprofits, universities, or organizations with legal teams

* Relays must self-elect to be exit nodes. Why?
	* Legal problems
	* If someone does something malicious or illegal using Tor and the police trace the traffic, the trace leads to the exit node


### Who knows what?
* Suppose the client is *Alice*.
* **Entry guard**: knows Alice is using Tor, and identity of *middle* relay, but not destination.
	* Every time Alice sends traffic, it simply sees a lot of traffic going to the *middle*.
* **Exit relay**: knows some Tor user is connecting to destination, but not which user
* **Destination**: knows a Tor user is connecting to it via the exit node

* Tor does not provide encryption between exit and destination (use HTTPS!)

### Does Tor provide anonymity?
* Tor provides for **anonymity in TCP connections** over the Internet, both unlinkably (long-term) and linkably (short-term).
* What does this mean?
	* There’s *no long-term identifier* for a Tor user
	* If a web server gets a connection from Tor today, and another one tomorrow, it won’t be able to tell whether those are from the same person
	* But two connections in quick succession from the same Tor node are more likely to in fact be from the same person

### Tor Challenges
* **Performance:** message bounces around a lot (can be slow)

* **Attack:** government can coerce server operators in one country
	* **Defense:** use mix servers (relays) in different legal jurisdictions

* **Attack:** adversary operates all of the mix servers
	* **Defense:** have lots of mix servers (Tor has ~7,000 onion routers today), and use a diverse set of mix servers.

* **Attack:** adversary observes when Alice sends and when Bob receives, links the two together
	* This is a side channel attack – exploits timing information
	* **Defenses:** pad messages, introduce significant delays
		* Tor does the former, but notes that it’s not enough for defense


### Hidden Services
* Throughout this whole process, the *client was anonymized but not the server.*

* Can we run an anonymous service (protect both client and server)?
	* E.g. a website, where nobody knows the IP address?
* Tor supports **Hidden Services**
	* Allows you to run a server without disclosing the IP or DNS name
	* E.g. Duck Duck Go, Tor Chat, Wikileaks


* **Goal:** Bob runs a website where no one knows Bob is running it, but its still accessible over the Tor network.

* Bob connects with some relays and builds a connection with them. They will redirect traffic to him.
![Pasted image 20240609224713](Pasted%20image%2020240609224713.png)

* Bob can post this on the database: if someone wants to connect to his site, they should go through one of these proxy sites.
![Pasted image 20240609224810](Pasted%20image%2020240609224810.png)

* Alice wants to talk to Bob. She makes a connection to the rendezvous point.
	* All of the traffic to Bob will be sent through the rendezvous point.
![Pasted image 20240609224847](Pasted%20image%2020240609224847.png)

* Alice then tells one of Bob's proxies that she wants to meet at this rendezvous point.
![Pasted image 20240609224853](Pasted%20image%2020240609224853.png)

* Bob can connect to Alice's rendezvous point and verify himself.
	* At this point, there is a circuit between Alice to RP, and another circule from RP to Bob.
	* Each circuit is a three way hop -> 7 total nodes between Alice and Bob.
		* The three-way hop protects the identity of each side.
![Pasted image 20240609224857](Pasted%20image%2020240609224857.png)

* At this point, they can just talk like normal.
	* The rendezvous point is useful to spread load across the Tor network...
		* Instead of concentrating traffic on Bob's proxies, they use many a unique RP to connect with each client.
![Pasted image 20240609224902](Pasted%20image%2020240609224902.png)

## Who uses anonymity systems?

* Tor is used by Journalists, Law Enforcement, Human Rights Activists, Business Executives,  Intelligence/Military, Normal People

* One of the main uses is to access **censored content**
	* Governments can block websites containing “offensive” content. They commonly employ blacklist approach
	* The censorship techniques include IP blocking, DNS blackholes, forged RST packets
	* Popular countermeasures are mostly proxy based (e.g. Tor, Freenet, Ultrasurf)
		* **Problem:** This is a cat-and-mouse game

# Email Protection

* Emails are sent over HTTPS -> this means the *connection between your mail server* and the other side's mail server is *encrypted*.

* **Issue:** the mail servers can still read your email.
	* E.g. your email provider may be required to turn over your (securely stored) email due to a warrant

## PGP
* This is the most widely used method to protect email content from the mail servers.

* Each user has:
	* A public encryption key, paired with a private decryption key
	* A private signature key, paired with a public verification key

### Sending and Receiving

* **To send a message:**
	* Sign the message with your signature key
	* Encrypt message and signature with recipient's public encryption key
* **To receive a message:**
	* Decrypt with your private key to get message and signature
	* Use sender's public verification key to check the signature

### Keys
* How do you obtain Bob's public key?
	* Get from Bob's website? (bad)
	* Get from Bob's website, verify using out-of-band communication (good)
		* Keys are unwieldy fingerprints
		* A fingerprint is a cryptographic hash of a key
	* What if you don't personally know Bob?
		* Web of Trust (WoT)
		* Social Network (Keybase)

* What if Bob's machine is compromised?
	* His key material becomes known
	* Past messages can be decrypted and read
* You also have sender's signature on messages sent, so you can prove identity of sender
	* Sender must trust recipient's ability/desire to keep her statements private

### Modern

* PGP is very buggy, not good.
* If you want to send secure communications, use **Signal**
	* You can also use WhatsApp or iMessage, which kinda copy Signal's protocol
