# Recap: Web Same Origin Policy

- The SOP that we learned from last time was the DOM.
    
    ![Untitled 71.png](attachments/Untitled%2071.png)
    
- This DOM SOP has a few vulnerabilities.
    
    - Sometimes, as long as the attacker can make a request, they can carry out the attack.
        - E.g. [**attacker.com**](http://attacker.com) does not care about the response to its request.
    
    ![Untitled 1 38.png](attachments/Untitled%201%2038.png)
    
- These policies also apply for JavaScript → below is the script similar to above.
    
    ![Untitled 2 38.png](attachments/Untitled%202%2038.png)
    

## CORS

- The server can add the ACAO header to allow the requestor (on a different origin) to see the content of the response.
    
    ![Untitled 3 38.png](attachments/Untitled%203%2038.png)
    
- CORS also has pre-flight requests.
    
    - Ask the server for permission before sending the request itself.
    - Pre-flight depends on what is being sent → if it’s simple like just text, it likely will not do a pre-flight request.
    
    ![Untitled 4 37.png](attachments/Untitled%204%2037.png)
    

# Cookies

- In **HTTP**, cookies are set by → `Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>`
    - The server sends this header back to the browser in the response; the browser saves it.
- Cookies are sent if they are “in scope”
    
    - Every request to [`bank.com`](http://bank.com) gets all the saved cookies for `bank.com` sent with it, regardless of who is sending.
    
    ![Untitled 5 37.png](attachments/Untitled%205%2037.png)
    
    - It does not matter if the original requester is not `bank.com` → cookie is still sent.
    
    ![Untitled 6 36.png](attachments/Untitled%206%2036.png)
    

## Cookie SOP

- Cookies use a different definition of **origin** than the DOM.
    
    ![Untitled 7 36.png](attachments/Untitled%207%2036.png)
    
- What does it mean to be “in scope”?
    - If the **cookie domain is a suffix** of the URL domain, then its sent.
        
        - This is because domain grows to the left.
        
        ![Untitled 8 36.png](attachments/Untitled%208%2036.png)
        
    - If the **cookie path is a prefix** of the URL path, then its sent.
        
        - This is because path grows to the right.
        
        ![Untitled 9 35.png](attachments/Untitled%209%2035.png)
        
    - **Basically, cookies are sent to anything** **more specific** **than what set it.**
        
        ![Untitled 10 34.png](attachments/Untitled%2010%2034.png)
        

## Scoping Example

- For the first cookie, we are at [`login.site.com`](http://login.site.com) at the root path.
    - If we visit any path on that domain, the cookie is sent.
    - If we visit any subdomain (e.g. `hello.login.site.com`), the cookie is sent.
- The second cookie is at the base domain and the root path.
    - As such, cookies are sent to all subdomains and subpaths.
- The third cookie is at the base domain, but the path is very specific.
    - Cookie only sent if we have **more** specific (ie. more domain with same path).

![Untitled 11 34.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%2034.png)

## Setting Cookie Scope

- When we set a cookie, we can set it for yourself or anything **less specific** than you.

![Untitled 12 34.png](attachments/Untitled%2012%2034.png)

## No Domain Cookies

- If you specify no domain:
    - The browser interprets it as the cookie belonging to you.
    - The cookie will be sent to you, but no subdomain belonging to you.

![Untitled 13 33.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%2033.png)

## Cookie Scoping Examples

![Untitled 14 31.png](attachments/Untitled%2014%2031.png)

- In this example, the cookie will be sent to exact domain matches (`stanford.edu`) but not the subdomain (`cs155.stanford.edu`)

![Untitled 15 29.png](attachments/Untitled%2015%2029.png)

## Javascript Cookie Access

- You can access the in-scope cookies via the DOM.

![Untitled 16 29.png](attachments/Untitled%2016%2029.png)

## SOP Policy Collisions

- The JS access leads to some vulnerabilities.
- In the example below, `zakir` can’t access `dabo`'s cookies.
    
    - However, just because they are different in the cookie origin, does not mean they are different in the DOM origin.
    - Since they have the same DOM origin, the JS can access the cookie using an iframe.
    
    ![Untitled 17 26.png](attachments/Untitled%2017%2026.png)
    

  

- This also applies for **Third Party Access.**
    
    - JavaScript runs with the permission of the window → runs as origin that included it.
        - E.g. if you include load JS from [`google.com`](http://google.com) using code at `bank.com`, the JS will run as if it were at `bank.com`.
        - I.e. there is nothing that prevents third-party malicious JS from accessing your cookies if you include it in your site.
    
    ![Untitled 18 24.png](attachments/Untitled%2018%2024.png)
    

## HttpOnly Cookies

- This is an additional field on the `Set-Cookie` header that makes the cookie not accessible by JS via the `document.cookie` field.
    - Manually makes the cookie more secure by default.

![Untitled 19 21.png](attachments/Untitled%2019%2021.png)

## Secure Cookies

- There is an issue with HTTP cookies.
    
    - If you do everything correctly, connecting to [`bank.com`](http://bank.com) using **HTTPS**, no one can eavesdrop on what the cookie value is.
    - However, if an attacker can get you to use **HTTP**, your connection is not encrypted.
        - The cookie received from HTTPS gets sent when you go to HTTP, because the cookie origin does not include the scheme.
        - Since this cookie is sent on the unencrypted network, the attacker can read it.
    
    ![Untitled 20 21.png](attachments/Untitled%2020%2021.png)
    
- To fix this issue, add the `Secure` keyword.
    
    - Note that this is not a replacement for `HttpOnly`. You need both to prevent DOM access and unsecured access.
    
    ![Untitled 21 18.png](attachments/Untitled%2021%2018.png)
    

## Cookie Attack

1. First, you visit [`cs155.stanford.edu`](http://cs155.stanford.edu) and log in.
2. Then, you get back a session cookie that says `session=abc`.
    1. This cookie stored for `cs155.stanford.edu`.
3. Then, you go to `dabo.stanford.edu`. No cookies are sent because its not a subdomain.
4. Then `dabo`, who is **malicious,** decides to send a cookie with `Domain=stanford.edu`.
    1. This is allowed and stored for `stanford.edu`.
5. Then, the next time you visit `cs155.stanford.edu` , **you have two cookies in scope**.
    1. In this case, both cookies will get sent → you are allowed two cookies with same name but different values.
    2. When you try to look at the value `session`, it is kind of arbitrary which cookie returns the value.

# Session Hijacking Attack

![Untitled 23 13.png](attachments/Untitled%2023%2013.png)

# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF)

- This works because cookies are sent based on who the receiver is, not who sent the request.
    - If we can get a logged-in user to visit a malicious site, we can make a request that includes their cookie.
        
        ![Untitled 24 12.png](attachments/Untitled%2024%2012.png)
        
- As such, **cookie-based authentication** is not sufficient for requests that have side effects.
    - The user has no control over what cookies are sent, and malicious websites can send them without the user knowing.

## Preventing CSRF Attacks

![Untitled 25 9.png](attachments/Untitled%2025%209.png)

  

1. **Referer Validation**
    
    - Not as used anymore. Tells the server “who sent me to this location?”
        - Can we be used to figure out who sent this request.
    - The issue with this is that many requests don’t have anything in the `Referer` header.
        - This is because many browsers drop this header because it’s a privacy leak.
    
    ![Untitled 26 8.png](attachments/Untitled%2026%208.png)
    
      
    
2. **Secret Token Validation**
    - This is very standard in practice, used everytime we make a request not through JS (e.g. when submitting a form).
        
        - E.g. suppose we can transfer money through a field. Having the token ensures that attackers can’t just make a request to `/transfer` without the token.
        
        ![Untitled 27 7.png](attachments/Untitled%2027%207.png)
        
    - The token can’t be static → needs to be session-specific.
        
        - i.e. the token changes everytime we load the form or with each user.
        - Because of the SOP, the attacker cannot load the page and view what the token is.
        - [`attacker.com`](http://attacker.com) can log into [`bank.com`](http://bank.com) themselves, retrieve the static token, and include it in a future form submission.
        
        ![Untitled 28 6.png](attachments/Untitled%2028%206.png)
        

  

1. **Force CORS Pre-Flight**
    - This is used to secure JS and prevent CSRF via JS.
    - Change JS to force the browser to make the pre-flight check → this way, we know who the requestor is because of their pre-flight request.
        
        - If you add a random HTTP header, it forces a pre-flight check via CORS.
        
        ![Untitled 29 6.png](attachments/Untitled%2029%206.png)
        

  

1. **sameSite Cookies**
    
    - This is kind of the new way to prevent CSRF attacks.
    - This is an additiona keyword/header that makes sure cookies are not sent cross-site.
    
    ![Untitled 30 6.png](attachments/Untitled%2030%206.png)
    

## Other types of CSRF attacks

- There isn’t much security for accessing the local network.
- The attacker can send a bunch of code that access your local router and changes DNS settings to hijack the traffic.

![Untitled 31 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2031%205.png)

# SQL Injection

- Occurs when developers try to build SQL queries that use unsanitized user-provided.

## Shell/Command Injection

- Consider a sample program where we can inject input into a C program, similar to proj 1.
    - The goal of command injection is to **execute arbitrary comands on the system →** this is possible when a developer passes unsafe data into a shell.

![Untitled 32 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2032%205.png)

- This is an example of normal input.
    
    ![Untitled 33 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2033%205.png)
    
- This is an example of adversarial input.
    
    - Nothing prevented this input from the user. If we run this program, it will run the command below, leading to bad outcomes.
    
    ![Untitled 34 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2034%204.png)
    

## SQL Injection Example

- Consider the following login form.
    
    ![Untitled 35 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2035%204.png)
    
- If the user passes in **regular input**, then it works normally.
    
    ![Untitled 36 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2036%203.png)
    
- However, if the user puts in **bad input** (e.g. an extra quote), it can lead to SQL syntax errors.
    
    ![Untitled 37 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2037%203.png)
    
- This gets even worse whne the user puts in **malicious input**.
    
    - In SQL, putting `--` comments out the rest of the line.
    - In the example below, we’ve fully commented out the `pwd` check.
        - Here, you can get success as long as you know a username (don’t need `pwd`).
    
    ![Untitled 38 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2038%203.png)
    
- It’s also possible to just **discard the checks** alltogether.
    
    - Allows you to succeed without even username or password.
    - The example below first closes the context, then evaluates a statement that is always true.
    
    ![Untitled 39 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2039%203.png)
    
- We can use this to **cause significant damage**.
    
    ![Untitled 40 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2040%203.png)
    

## Escaping Database Server

- On Windows and Microsoft SQL, there is a SQL command that lets you run **system commands**.
    
    ![Untitled 41 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2041%202.png)
    
- In this example below:
    
    - It escapes the context of the SQL query.
    - Then, it runs a shell command to add a system user `usr` that run over the network.
    
    ![Untitled 42 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2042%202.png)
    

## Preventing SQL Injection

- In practice, never concatenate a user string into a command string.

![Untitled 43 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2043%202.png)

## Parameterized SQL

- Allows you to pass in parameters instead of manually building SQL queries.
    - The database takes care of the sanitization for you.
    - The `?` corresponds with the arguments given by the user.

![Untitled 44 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2044%202.png)

## Object Relational Mappers

- Allows you to write SQL in Python (or whatever language you’re using).

![Untitled 45 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2045%202.png)

# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

- This is the client-side version of SQL injection.
    - In SQL injection, the malicious code is run on the app’s server.
    - In XSS, the code is executed on the victim’s browser.
        - Happens when the app receives a request, takes that untrusted data, then sends it back to the browser.
- This is usually about JS.
    - Attacker use it to inject JS into victim’s browser.

![Untitled 46 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2046%202.png)

## XSS Example

- Suppose we are implementing Google.
    
    - When the user makes a request with the search term parameter:
        1. The server gets that query term.
        2. Then it responds to the user with a HTML page with the results.
    
    ![Untitled 47 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2047%202.png)
    
- This leads to issues if an **attacker can get the user to visit a site that injects HTML** code into the query.
    
    - The app server will take this query and inject it into the template.
    - Then, when the browser receives it, it thinks it’s just a regular script that’s part of the response, and it executes it.
    
    ![Untitled 48 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2048%202.png)
    
- This can be used to **steal cookies**.
    
    ![Untitled 49 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2049%202.png)
    

## Types of XSS

![Untitled 50 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2050%202.png)

- The examples from above were all **reflected XSS.**
    - We sent something to the server, the server stuck it in the HTML, then sent it back.
- **Stored XSS:**
    - E.g. Suppose I send you a forum post. You share that forum post to other users. Now, all those other users are running the JS code that you put in your post.

## Reflected Example: PayPal

- The attacker brought the user to a user that starts with `paypal.com`.
    - However, the rest of the URL (e.g. the variables) were malicious.

![Untitled 51 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2051%202.png)

## Stored Example: Samy Worm

- When you went to this person’s MySpace page, it would run JS that would change your own personal profile.
    
    - i.e. if you went to an attacker/infected person’s profile, it takes your own profile.
    
    ![Untitled 52 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2052%202.png)
    
- The issue was that MySpace did not correctly filter out the requests on people’s pages.
    
    - It let you put in HTML on their pages in order to do stuff with text.
    - It filtered out the ways it thought people might invoke JS, but forgot one.
    
    ![Untitled 53 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2053%202.png)
    

## Filtering Malicious Tags

![Untitled 54 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2054%202.png)

![Untitled 55 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2055%202.png)

- Filters also need to make sure the things it removes does not create new malicious tags.
    
    ![Untitled 56 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2056%202.png)
    

# Content Security Policies (Prevents XSS)

- Instead of filtering and blacklisting certain code, whitelist code that is allowed.

![Untitled 57 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2057%202.png)

## CSP directives

- The policy below states that `script-src` is only allowed to be `self`.
    
    - This prevents external JS from being loaded and executed.
    - If you are [`bank.com`](http://bank.com), only JS from `bank.com` can be loaded and executed.
    - This also prevents inline `script` tags from executing.
    
    ![Untitled 58 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2058%202.png)
    

  

- The policy below allows JS from any external domain.
    
    - Still prevents inline `script` tags from executing.
    
    ![Untitled 59 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2059%202.png)
    

  

- There is a **default policy** that prevents most problems.
    
    ![Untitled 60 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2060%202.png)
    

  

- There are a lot of other directives out there. You can also define **multiple directive**.
    
    ![Untitled 61 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2061%202.png)
    

## Mozilla Recommended Directive

![Untitled 62 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2062%202.png)

## Report Mode Only

- Instead of breaking the website and preventing things from happening, it only tells the server **what broke** so they can fix it.

![Untitled 63 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2063%202.png)

## Real-World Breaks CSP

- The bad news is that the CSP is at odds with how we’ve defined things from the past.
- The script below is the code that is given to you when you load from Google Analytics.
    
    - This tag makes it so that the analytics are specific to you and the site you’re on.
    
    ![Untitled 64 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2064%202.png)
    

  

- If we implement CSP, it will prevent this from working because the inline script can’t run.
    
    ![Untitled 65 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2065%202.png)
    

# Protection for iFrames

- There is something similar to CSPs for iFrames.
    - This is useful when you load ads from a third-party website.
    - We can create rules for what an iFrame is allowed to do.

![Untitled 66 2.png](attachments/Untitled%2066%202.png)

- In practice, this doesn’t really get used because it’s too hard to deploy.
