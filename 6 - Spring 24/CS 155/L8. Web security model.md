# Outline

![Untitled 72.png](attachments/Untitled%2072.png)

## Web Security Goals

- Safely browse the web in the face of attackers
- Visit a website (including malicious ones!) without incurring harm
    - **Site A** cannot steal data from your device, install malware, access camera, etc.
        - Site cannot break out of the browser sandbox.
    - **Site A** cannot affect session on Site B or eavesdrop on Site B
- Support secure high-performance web apps (e.g., Google Meet)

## Web Attack Models

![Untitled 1 39.png](attachments/Untitled%201%2039.png)

1. **Malicious website:** victim accidentally visits a malicious website, and are exposed.
2. **Malicious external resources:** a safe website can load malicious resources.
3. **Network attacker:** an attacker (e.g. the owner of the Wi-Fi access point) eavesdrops on your connection with a server.
4. **Malware attacker:** this is outside of the web security model → this is system security, browser sandbox.

# HTTP Protocol

- This is a message and response protocol → browser sends a request to server, then the server responds, then the protocol ends. Then repeat with another request.

![Untitled 2 39.png](attachments/Untitled%202%2039.png)

## Port Numbers

- Port 80 is the default web HTTP port → used for sending clear/plaintext
- Port 443 is the default TLS port → used for encrypted/ciphertext
- Port 25 is the default port for SMTP (mail protocol)

## HTTP Request

- The header contains some information about the client.
    - **User-Agent** tells the server what the user’s browser is (can lie about this)
    - **Host** tells the server the intended host.
        - This is useful if there are multiple domain names hosted on the same IP address.
        - Recall that networking only routes it to the IP address → the destination has to figure out which domain it’s supposed to go to.
            - Also, packets may be delivered to the wrong person, or it may have to go through many routers to get to the destination.
    - **Referrer** tells the server how the user got to the page that made this request.
        - If you were on Google then you clicked on a link, the **Referrer** will have the Google link that you were at.
- Typically, `GET` requests have an empty body.

![Untitled 3 39.png](attachments/Untitled%203%2039.png)

## HTTP Response

- The status code tells us whether the response is well formed.
- The **body** is the content that we asked for.

![Untitled 4 38.png](attachments/Untitled%204%2038.png)

## `GET` vs `POST`

- **GET** requests are designed for requests that have no side-effects → only ask for a resource from the web server.
- **POST** requests can have side effects and parameters → may change server state.
    - In this case, notice that the **body** of the **POST** request has a bunch of info.

![Untitled 5 38.png](attachments/Untitled%205%2038.png)

## HTTP Methods

![Untitled 6 37.png](attachments/Untitled%206%2037.png)

![Untitled 7 37.png](attachments/Untitled%207%2037.png)

- The request at the bottom should be a POST request, because it’s a transfer → change state on the server.

## Loading Resources

1. When you enter a site, it sends a **GET** request to get the HTML for the site.
    
    ![Untitled 8 37.png](attachments/Untitled%208%2037.png)
    
2. The HTML file might point to a bunch of sub-resources like images. These would require another **GET** request for those resources.
    
    ![Untitled 9 36.png](attachments/Untitled%209%2036.png)
    
3. These sub-resources don’t need to be self-contained. They can be external.
    
    ![Untitled 10 35.png](attachments/Untitled%2010%2035.png)
    

> [!important]  
> The client does not know what type the response will be → it can be HTML, an image, malicious → need to be prepared for server to reply with anything.  

![Untitled 11 35.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%2035.png)

## Forms

- When the user hits the submit button, it will send **POST** request with the form fields as parameters.

![Untitled 12 35.png](attachments/Untitled%2012%2035.png)

## HTTP/2

- Improves on HTTP → instead of one request/response per connection, we can multiplex to do multiple requests.
- Header compression → saves space by compressing the header (before is just ASCII)

![Untitled 13 34.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%2034.png)

# JavaScript

- Allows for dynamic content within web pages → scripts run the code inside the browser.

![Untitled 14 32.png](attachments/Untitled%2014%2032.png)

## Document Object Model (DOM)

- A list of objects that correspond to HTML elements on the page.
    - If you do `dom.html.head` → corresponds to `<head>` element of `<html>`

![Untitled 15 30.png](attachments/Untitled%2015%2030.png)

- **Fragments:** if you have a URL that says `\#demo`, it will jump to the object with `id="demo"`

## Frames

- Allows one page to create a frame owned by a different website inside of that page.

![Untitled 16 30.png](attachments/Untitled%2016%2030.png)

- In the example, we’re in page `a.com`. Inside it, there are two frames: [`b.com`](http://b.com) and `c.com`. Inside `c.com`, there is a subframe `d.com`.
- I**ssue:** different elements in the DOM hierarchy can be owned by different entity.
    - This leads to issues of trust: if the NYT loads an ad, the ad provider should not be able to see what NYT article the person is reading.
    - Frames separate access based on the origin of the element.

## Basic Execution Model

# Cookies + Sessions

- Recall that HTTP is stateless.
    
    - This means that every request is independent of every other request.
    - In order to have sessions (sustained state), we use **cookies**
    
    ![Untitled 18 25.png](attachments/Untitled%2018%2025.png)
    
- All browsers have a separate **cookie** database, stored on the local computer, that stores all of the cookies that it has.
    - Servers can’t assume that if it sends someone a cookie, it will come back unmodified.
        - Users and malicious attackers can change the cookie at will.
        - Typically, websites will encrypt the cookie and include a cryptographic checksum so that users can’t modify it.

## HTTP Cookies

- There are inherently issues with the cookie design, but we can’t change it because it will break the web altogether.

![Untitled 19 22.png](attachments/Untitled%2019%2022.png)

## Setting and Sending Cookie

- When you visit a website:
    - The server may send you back an **HTTP response** that includes a cookie.
        - They respond with a **Set-Cookie** header → in the example below, it sets two cookies.
    - The browser can remember the cookie.
        - The browser has a database of cookies → name-value pair
    - The next time the browser visits that website, it will echo the cookie back the server.
        - It echoes the cookies that were **set by the website** you’re visiting.
    - This cookie allows the server to link this new request to an old request.

![Untitled 20 22.png](attachments/Untitled%2020%2022.png)

![Untitled 21 19.png](attachments/Untitled%2021%2019.png)

## First vs. Third-Party Cookie

- Suppose I go to a website `www.example.com`, and the root HTML page (at `www.example.com`) sets a cookie on the browser.
    - This is a **first-party cookie**.
    - The examples above are also first-party cookies.
- Now suppose the root HTML that gets resources from another domain (e.g. `www.ad.com`).
    - The response for this inner request may also contain a cookie → gets stored as belonging to `www.ad.com`
        - This is a **third-party cookie**. The user did not visit this, but the cookie was still set.
- The problem is that if we go to another website [`www.news.com`](http://www.news.com) that also gets a resource from `www.ad.com`, the browser can send the **third-party cookie** that was set at [`www.example.com`](http://www.example.com) to `www.ad.com`.
    - Now, [`www.ad.com`](http://www.ad.com) knows what websites the user visited → able to track across websites.
- Ad companies depend on third-party cookies and cross-site tracking to show targeted and relevant advertisements.
- **Safari does not allow third-party cookies → help with privacy of user.**

## Login Session

- This is an example of a how a login session might work.
    1. You first request `/loginform`.
        1. The browser responds with the HTML for the login page and form.
    2. Then, you login by sending a POST request to `/login`.
        1. The browser processes this and responds with your session cookie. You can use this for session management, keeping you logged in between requests.
    3. Since you now have the cookie, you can make additional account-protected requests without having to login again.
- **Issue:** if we use purely cookies for session management: once the cookie has been identified with you → if someone steals the cookie, they can masquerade as you.
    - In most cases, session cookies are bound to multiple things (IP address, time, machine, etc.) to prevent the cookie from being stolen.

![Untitled 22 15.png](attachments/Untitled%2022%2015.png)

## Cookie Properties

- **Deleting cookies:** every cookie has an expiration period → if a website wants to delete a cookie (e.g. log you out), they set the cookie again with an expiration time in the past.
    - Once it expires, the browser will delete the cookie.
- **Tabs:** Tabs have shared cookie jars. Your cookies set on one tab are also usable by the same website on a different tab.
    
    ![Untitled 23 14.png](attachments/Untitled%2023%2014.png)
    
- **Sent:** once the cookies for a site are set, they will always be sent when you visit that site.
    
    ![Untitled 24 13.png](attachments/Untitled%2024%2013.png)
    
    - **XSRF (cross site request forgery) Attack:** This can be abused. Suppose we had a cookie set for [`bank.com`](http://bank.com). Then, when we are at `stanford.edu`, if we load a resource from `bank.com`, the browser will send the `bank.com` cookies, even though this was code provided by `stanford.edu`.
        
        - If the request was a POST request, the browser will send all the authentication cookies to `bank.com`, even though this is unsafe code.
            - Notice that the code transfers money from account X to account Y.
        
        ![Untitled 25 10.png](attachments/Untitled%2025%2010.png)
        
- **POST** requests also send cookies.
    
    - These are sent to the browser and sent back to the server via HTTP headers.
    
    ![Untitled 26 9.png](attachments/Untitled%2026%209.png)
    

## Cache

- The cookie database from the browser cache.
- **Cache:** when you go to a website and the website sends you images, the browser will cache those images.
    - The next time you go to the site → browser asks site if image has changed → if not, it will serve image from cache → reduces internet traffic
- **Non-cookie based tracking:** if you visit a website and they want to track you, they can drop a bunch of images on your browser and the browser will automatically cache those.
    - The next time to go to that website, the browser asks what images have changed.
    - Which images the browser asks about could be the identifier that identifies you

## Modern Website

- Modern websites have a lot of resources.
    
    - E.g. the LA Times includes 540 resources from nearly 270 IP addresses (aka websites), 58 networks, and 8 countries.
    - Many of these are not controlled by the main sent.
    
    ![Untitled 27 8.png](attachments/Untitled%2027%208.png)
    
- They also set many cookies in the browser. Notice that many are encrypted.
    
    - E.g. the ones below are the cookies that the LA times drops into your browser.
    
    ![Untitled 28 7.png](attachments/Untitled%2028%207.png)

# Same Origin Policy (Origins)

- This policy is used for **web isolation** → ensures that Site A cannot affect session on Site B or eavesdrop on Site B.

## Security Model

- This mirrors the UNIX security model. Recall that UNIX had:
    1. Subjects (Who?) → users, processes
    2. Objects (What?) → files (sockets, pipes, devices, etc.), directories
    3. Access Operations (How?) → read, write, execute
- The web security model is:
    1. Subjects → origins
        1. Origins are a unique `**scheme://domain:port**`
        2. All of these are different origins — cannot access one another
            1. [http://stanford.edu](http://stanford.edu/)
            2. [http://](http://www.stanford.edu/)**[www](http://www.stanford.edu/)**[.stanford.edu](http://www.stanford.edu/)
            3. [http://stanford.edu:](http://stanford.edu:8080/)**[8080](http://stanford.edu:8080/)**
            4. **[https](https://stanford.edu/)**[://stanford.edu](https://stanford.edu/)
        3. These origins are the same — can access one another
            1. [https://stanford.edu](https://stanford.edu/)
            2. [https://stanford.edu:80](https://stanford.edu:80/)
            3. [https://stanford.edu/cs](https://stanford.edu/cs)
    2. Objects
        1. DOM tree, DOM storage, cookies, JavaScript namespace, hardware permission
    3. Same Origin Policy (SOP) → this is just for the DOM; cookies have another policy
        1. **Goal:** isolate content of different origins.
            - Confidentiality: script on [evil.com](http://evil.com/) should not be able to read [bank.ch](http://bank.ch/)
            - Integrity: [evil.com](http://evil.com/) should not be able to modify the content of [bank.ch](http://bank.ch/)
- The model states that different origins should be isolated from one another.
    - If you are in different origins, you cannot read any part of the DOM of the other origin.
        - If we load a script from somewhere else, that script can’t read the DOM.
    - If you are in the same origin, you can read every part of the DOM.

## Bounding Origins

- The only thing that can be access across origins is the width and height of the frame.

![Untitled 29 7.png](attachments/Untitled%2029%207.png)

![Untitled 30 7.png](attachments/Untitled%2030%207.png)

# Same Origin Policy (HTTP)

## HTTP: Origins and Cookies

![Untitled 31 6.png](attachments/Untitled%2031%206.png)

## HTTP: SOP for Responses

- We can still make requests and get responses across origins.

![Untitled 32 6.png](attachments/Untitled%2032%206.png)

![Untitled 33 6.png](attachments/Untitled%2033%206.png)

- [`attacker.com`](http://attacker.com) cannot read any HTML information inside the frame for `bank.com`

## HTTP: Script Execution

- In the first example, [`bank.com`](http://bank.com) is loading the `jquery` script locally from itself.
- In the second example, it loads it from [`jquery.com`](http://jquery.com) → a different domain/origin.
    - Since they execute with the parent’s origin, you’ve just allowed [`jquery.com`](http://jquery.com) to run a script with the full privileges of `bank.com`.

> [!important]  
> When you load a script into your own origin, even if the script is coming from somewhere else, that script runs as if it was a script created by your origin.The external script runs with the same privileges as your code.  

![Untitled 34 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2034%205.png)

# Domain Relaxation

- In the example below, [`facebook.com`](http://facebook.com) loads a frame from `cdn.facebook.com`
    
    - These are different origins → cannot access each other’s DOM
    
    ![Untitled 35 5.png](attachments/Untitled%2035%205.png)
    
- If you want these two to be able to access each other, you can change your `document.domain` to be a **super-domain**.
    
    - Normally, `document.domain` tells you what origin the site is on.
    - You can manually set this to be a super-domain of yourself → moves the subdomain upwards so that you can be in same origin.
    
    ![Untitled 36 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2036%204.png)
    

## Domain Relaxation Attacks

- In the example below, we changed the `document.domain` of [`cs155.stanford.edu`](http://cs155.stanford.edu) → this makes the frame and the window same origin, so they can read each other’s info.
    
    ![Untitled 37 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2037%204.png)
    
- **Mutual Agreement:** This leads to security issues if one site is not trustable.
    
    ![Untitled 38 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2038%204.png)
    

## Inter-Frame Communication

- We can use `postMessage` to send messages between windows and frames, even if they have different origins.
    1. You get `targetWindow`, a handle to another window or frame.
    2. Then you send a message and specify `targetOrigin`, the origin that will receive your message.
        1. Basically, the program does not know the origin of `targetWindow`, so you need to specify it → only dispatch if the origin of the loaded frame matches specified.

![Untitled 39 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2039%204.png)

# Same Origin Policy (JavaScript)

## JavaScript XHR

- XHR is used to request sub-resources from another origin and have complete control over it.
    - Looking at the `onload`, you can see that my origin can fully read the response of the XHR, even though the response came from a different origin.
- This is how it works:
    - We create a new XHR object
    - We set it to send a request to `/article/example`
    - Then you send the request.
    - Once the `onload` event triggers, the function triggers and reads the response.

![Untitled 40 4.png](attachments/Untitled%2040%204.png)

## Malicious XHR

- You can use XHR to mount attacks, since it gets around the same origin policy.
    - For example:
        - [`attacker.com`](http://attacker.com) can send a request to [`bank.com`](http://bank.com)
        - Then, they can read the response and ask for something like account balances.

![Untitled 41 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2041%203.png)

## XHR SOP

- XHR can violate the SOP because:
    - The cookie will be sent with the request.
    - And also because of the CORS header.

![Untitled 42 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2042%203.png)

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- This is a header that is included in the request/response.

![Untitled 43 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2043%203.png)

- The left side is the browser, and the right side is the browser → two different origins.
    
    - The browser is sending POST request to `api.c.com`
        1. The browser sends a preflight OPTIONS request to the server to ask if [`app.c.com`](http://app.c.com) can request a resource from `api.c.com`.
            1. If it is okay, it will respond with the ACAO header approving the request.
        2. The browser then sends the POST request once it has been approved.
            1. **Does not violate SOP because origin specifically allowed it.**
    
    ![Untitled 44 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2044%203.png)
    
- **Wildcard origins:** This allows anyone to read the data that is replied by the web server.
    
    ![Untitled 45 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2045%203.png)
    
- **CORS Failure:** it simply replies with an error if the OPTIONS call fails.
    
    ![Untitled 46 3.png](attachments/Untitled%2046%203.png)
    

## CORS and Simple Requests

- Note that in order to send data, we need to set the `content type` of the header.
    
    ```JavaScript
    req.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
    ```
