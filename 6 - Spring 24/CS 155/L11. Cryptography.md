# Section 1: Symmetric Encryption, Public Key Encryption, and TLS

- It is:
    - a tool for protecting information
    - the basis for many security mechanisms
- Is not:
    - the solution to all security problems
    - reliable unless implemented and used properly
    - something you should try to invent yourself



# Goal 1: Secure Communication

- This means protecting data in motion → prevent eavesdropping and tampering

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

![[attachments/Untitled 85.png|Untitled 85.png]]



- Handshake protocol: cause browser and web server to agree on a shared key.



# Goal 2: Protected Files

- This means protecting data when they are at rest (in a file system)
    - Alice should be able to encrypt a file, and still read it later.

# Symmetric Cipher (ENCs)

- Alice is trying to send a message to Bob.
    - There are two cipher algorithms: E (encryption) and D (decryption)
    - Both of these algorithms take the same key $k$﻿
    - E takes the plaintext $m$﻿ and a nonce $n$﻿. It produces a ciphertext $c$﻿
    - D takes the ciphertext $c$﻿ and the nonce $n$﻿. It reproduces the plaintext $m$﻿
- The nonce is non-repeating
    - For a particular key, every message you send should have a different nonce.

## Single-use vs. Multi-use

- The single-use key is done through the handshake protocol.
- The nonce is useful when you use the same key many times.
    - Typically, we use a random nonce. If the bounds are big enough, we are guaranteed to never repeat.

## One Time Pad (single use)

- This is one of the first examples of symmetric ciphers.
    - We turn the plaintext and key into a sequence of bits.
    - **To encrypt:** we xor the plaintext with the key
    - **To decrypt:** we xor the ciphertext with the key



![[attachments/Untitled 4 51.png|Untitled 4 51.png]]



- Shannon (1949) said:
    - OTP is secure against one-time eavesdropping → if adversary sees just one ciphertext, they can’t decipher it.
    - Without the key, the ciphertext reveals no information about plaintext.
- **Problems:**
    - We can’t use this to encrypt multiple messages.
    - The OTP needs to be as long as the message.
- In practice, OTP is never used.



## Stream Ciphers (single use)

- We use a pseudo random key.
    - We start with a short key (e.g. 16 to 32 bytes)
    - We apply a pseudo random generate to the key → expand it into the desired length.
        - Output looks uniformly random, but is deterministic given the key.



![[attachments/Untitled 5 51.png|Untitled 5 51.png]]



- **Problem:** there is no nonce → one key can only be used on one message
    - If the attacker has access to $c_1$﻿ and $c_2$﻿, they can retrieve the xor of the plaintexts.
    - Given the xor of the plaintexts (in English), you can recover the exact messages.

![[attachments/Untitled 6 50.png|Untitled 6 50.png]]



## Block Cipher (AES, multi-use)

- A symmetric cipher that operates on fix-sized blocks.
    - The cipher is applied to $n$﻿-bit blocks of the plaintext.
- AES has variable key sizes → most companies use 256 bits (biggest key)

![[attachments/Untitled 7 50.png|Untitled 7 50.png]]



- The block cipher is built by iteration.
    - We first take our key $k$﻿ and expand it into a bunch of keys $k_1, \dots, k_n$﻿
        - This might be with a pseudorandom generator, etc.
    - We take the message and iteratively apply the **round function** with different keys.
        - The round function is a primitive block cipher.
            - The round function tries to emulate a random function.
            - It is insecure on its own, but secure with iteration.
- For AES128, we iterative it 10 rounds to be secure. For AES256, we do 14 rounds.
    - Quirk: the last round of AES is different from all the other rounds → uses a different round function.
    - AES runtime scales linearly with the number of rounds.

![[attachments/Untitled 8 50.png|Untitled 8 50.png]]



- AES is built into hardware on many platforms.
    - The `aes enc` executes one round of AES. In the last round, you use `aes enc last`
    - In modern machines, you implement AES by using these instructions.
- AES-NI is almost more secure because it prevents side-channel timing attacks.
    - If you implement in software, the running time of AES depends on the secret key.
    - Attackers can use side-channel timing attacks to find the key.

![[attachments/Untitled 9 49.png|Untitled 9 49.png]]



- If you don’t have AES-NI implemented in hardware, the best software encryption is the stream cipher.
    - Most cheap android phones that don’t support AES use ChaCha20, using a library that implements it in constant time.



### Incorrect Use of Block Ciphers (ECB mode)

- If you want to encode a movie, the most natural thing to do is:
    - Break the movie into 16 byte blocks.
    - Encrypt each block into ciphertext.
    - **This is called ECB mode**
- ECB mode is very insecure:
    - If we have two blocks that are the same, the cipher text will be the same.
        - This leaks information about the plaintext to attackers.

![[attachments/Untitled 11 48.png|Untitled 11 48.png]]



### How to Use Block Ciphers (CTR mode)

- In this mode:
    - we choose a random nonce $IV$﻿
    - we break our message into the 16 byte blocks
    - we encrypt the nonce → $\texttt{AES}(k, IV)$﻿
        - this generates a random pad
    - we take the random pad and xor it with our message to get ciphertext
- Essentially, we are using AES itself as a pseudorandom generator.
- **Advantage:**
    - this allows us to encrypt in parallel → each block is independent of the other

![[attachments/Untitled 12 48.png|Untitled 12 48.png]]



- To decrypt this, we use the nonce to regenerate the pad `E(k, IV)`, and xor it with the cipher text.
    - Essentially, we are **only using AES encryption** to both encrypt the message and decrypt the message (in counter mode)
    - This is super similar to stream ciphers.



![[attachments/Untitled 13 46.png|Untitled 13 46.png]]

- If an attacker modified the cipher text, the decryptor would not know that it was modified.

# Message Integrity (MACs)

- MAC stands for message authentication code → basically means message integrity
    - Does not provide confidentiality.
- When Alice sends a message:
    - She generates a tag `S(k, m)` and attaches it to the message
        - This tag is like the signature of the message → cryptography checksum
    - Bob verifies the tag `V(k, m, tag)` using the shared key
        - This lets Bob know if the message was tampered

![[attachments/Untitled 14 44.png|Untitled 14 44.png]]



## HMAC (Hash-MAC)

- We typically build MACs using hash functions with HMAC.
- HMAC works like so:
    - We take our `msg` and prepend the key `k` to it.
    - We hash the result → `H(k xor ipad || msg)`
    - We then prepend the key to that hash → `H(k xor opad || H(k xor ipad || msg))`
    - Then we hash the result again.

![[attachments/Untitled 15 42.png|Untitled 15 42.png]]

- We assume H to be a cryptographic hash function where data is hashed by iterating a basic compression function on blocks of data.
    - We denote by B the byte-length of such blocks
    - The inner pad `ipad` = the byte 0x36 repeated B times
    - The outer pad `opad` = the byte 0x5C repeated B times.



# Combining MAC and ENC

- So far, we know:
    - encryption → provides confidentiality but no integrity
    - message integrity with MAC → provides integrity but no confidentiality.
- We now put them together to have both **confidentiality and integrity**
    - This is called **Authenticated Encryption**
- For the remainder, suppose we have an **encryption key** $k_E$﻿ **and a MAC key** $K_I$﻿

## SSL - Option 1

- This is a predecessor to TLS.

![[attachments/Untitled 16 40.png|Untitled 16 40.png]]

- To encrypt:
    1. We take message $m$﻿.
    2. We append a MAC to message $m$﻿
    3. We encrypt the entire message and MAC together.
- To decypt:
    1. We decrypt the cipher text.
    2. We then verify the MAC.
    3. If MAC is valid, we output the message.
- The issue with this is that the attacker can give you invalid ciphertext.
    - When you decrypt the ciphertext, it can lead to attacks (bc its unauthenticated data)

## TLS - Option 2

![[attachments/Untitled 17 37.png|Untitled 17 37.png]]

- To encrypt:
    1. We take message $m$﻿.
    2. We encrypt $m$﻿ to create ciphertext $c$﻿
    3. We compute a MAC on the ciphertext $c$﻿
    4. We append the MAC to the ciphertext.
- To decypt:
    1. We verify the MAC on the ciphertext.
    2. If MAC is valid, we decrypt the ciphertext.
    3. Then we output the plaintext.
- **TLS is the only one that is always correct → we first encrypt, then MAC**
    - Guarantees that you only decrypt on authenticated data

## SSH - Option 3

![[attachments/Untitled 18 35.png|Untitled 18 35.png]]

- To encrypt:
    1. We take message $m$﻿.
    2. We encrypt $m$﻿ to create ciphertext $c$﻿
    3. We compute a MAC on the message $m$﻿
    4. We append the MAC to the ciphertext.
- To decypt:
    1. We decrypt the cipher text.
    2. We verify the MAC with the plaintext.
    3. If MAC is valid, we output the plaintext.
- The issue with this is that the MAC might lead information about the message.



## AEAD

- When we apply encryption to a network packet, it typically has a header.
    - We **cannot encrypt this header** because it tells the router how to route the packet.
- We’d like to provide integrity for the header, but not encryption.
    - We only encrypt the payload of the packet.
- **Implementation:** The MAC is computed over the encrypted data + associated data.
    - Provides integrity for both encrypted data and associated data.

![[attachments/Untitled 19 32.png|Untitled 19 32.png]]



- The most common way to implement AEAD is using AES-GCM:

    1. counter mode encryption of payload with AES
    2. then compute MAC over all data

    ![[attachments/Untitled 20 32.png|Untitled 20 32.png]]




- Make sure the IV/nonce is different for each message.

# Summary

![[attachments/Untitled 21 29.png|Untitled 21 29.png]]



- If you only need integrity → use HMAC
- If you need confidentiality and integrity → use AES-GCM


# Section 2: Encryption and Compression Problems

- Encryption and compression are like oil and water → they don’t mix well
- But **HTTP** uses compression to reduce bandwidth and network traffic.

![[attachments/Untitled 22 25.png|Untitled 22 25.png]]
- Once you encrypt, the ciphertext looks like random data → random data is not very compressible.
![[attachments/Untitled 23 23.png|Untitled 23 23.png]]
- Compressing then encrypting causes security issues.
    - Eavesdroppers can see the compression ratio as a side-channel.
![[attachments/Untitled 24 22.png|Untitled 24 22.png]]

## Ex: the CRIME Attack
- An attacker can issue requests by making the user visit a malicious site.
    - The browser will attach cookies to the request, but attacker can’t read the cookie value.
        ![[attachments/Untitled 25 19.png|Untitled 25 19.png]]

    - However, they can see the see the **size of the ciphertext**
        ![[attachments/Untitled 26 16.png|Untitled 26 16.png]]
- This ciphertext size allows them to find the cookie!
    - There are 256 possible characters per letter of the cookie → they can brute force the cookie in a few minutes.
![[attachments/Untitled 27 15.png|Untitled 27 15.png]]
## What to Do?
- Disable compression ☹
    - This defeats the goal of reducing network traffic
- Use a different compression context for parts under Javascript control and parts that are not
    - Do LZW using different tables on different parts of the message.
    - **Problem:** this does not eliminate inherent leakage due to compression
- Change secret (Cookie) after every request
    - This prevents the CRIME attack → because cookie changes
    - When building authentication systems, make sure the cookie changes after every request.

# Section 3: Asymmetric/Public Key Cryptography

- The idea with this is that now, we have **many senders** and **one receiver**.

![[attachments/Untitled 28 14.png|Untitled 28 14.png]]



- Bob will generate a secret key `sk` for itself, and publish a public key `pk` that anyone can use to encrypt messages to Bob.
    - Called asymmetric because others encrypt with `pk`, while Bob decrypts with `sk`

![[attachments/Untitled 29 13.png|Untitled 29 13.png]]



## Building Block: Trapdoor Permutations

1. Algorithm `KeyGen`
    1. Generates and outputs the keys `pk` and `sk`
2. Algorithm `F(pk, ×)` : a one-way function
    1. Given a public key, takes any input `x` and outputs `y = F(pk, x)`
    2. One-way:
        1. Computing `y = F(pk, x)` is easy
        2. Given random `y`, finding `x` s.t. `y = F(pk,x)` is very difficult
3. Algorithm `F⁻¹(sk, x)`
    1. Invert `F(pk, ×)` using trapdoor `sk`
        1. If given the secret key, inverting the function becomes easy
    2. This mean `F⁻¹(sk, y) = x`



## Example: RSA
