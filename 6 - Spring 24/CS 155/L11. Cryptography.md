# Section 1: Symmetric Encryption, Public Key Encryption, and TLS

- It is:
	- a tool for protecting information
	- the basis for many security mechanisms
- Is not:
	- the solution to all security problems
	- reliable unless implemented and used properly
	- something you should try to invent yourself

# Goal 1: Secure Communication

- This means protecting data in motion → prevent eavesdropping and tampering

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

![Untitled 85.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2085.png)

- Handshake protocol: cause browser and web server to agree on a shared key.

# Goal 2: Protected Files

- This means protecting data when they are at rest (in a file system)
	- Alice should be able to encrypt a file, and still read it later.

![Untitled 1 52.png](../../attachments/Untitled%201%2052.png)

# Symmetric Cipher (ENCs)

- Alice is trying to send a message to Bob.
	- There are two cipher algorithms: E (encryption) and D (decryption)
	- Both of these algorithms take the same key $k$﻿
	- E takes the plaintext $m$﻿ and a nonce $n$﻿. It produces a ciphertext $c$﻿
	- D takes the ciphertext $c$﻿ and the nonce $n$﻿. It reproduces the plaintext $m$﻿
- The nonce is non-repeating
	- For a particular key, every message you send should have a different nonce.

![Untitled 2 52.png](../../attachments/Untitled%202%2052.png)

## Single-use vs. Multi-use

- The single-use key is done through the handshake protocol.
- The nonce is useful when you use the same key many times.
	- Typically, we use a random nonce. If the bounds are big enough, we are guaranteed to never repeat.

![Untitled 3 52.png](../../attachments/Untitled%203%2052.png)

## One Time Pad (single use)

- This is one of the first examples of symmetric ciphers.
	- We turn the plaintext and key into a sequence of bits.
	- **To encrypt:** we xor the plaintext with the key
	- **To decrypt:** we xor the ciphertext with the key

![Untitled 4 51.png](../../attachments/Untitled%204%2051.png)

- Shannon (1949) said:
	- OTP is secure against one-time eavesdropping → if adversary sees just one ciphertext, they can’t decipher it.
	- Without the key, the ciphertext reveals no information about plaintext.
- **Problems:**
	- We can’t use this to encrypt multiple messages.
	- The OTP needs to be as long as the message.
- In practice, OTP is never used.

## Stream Ciphers (single use)

- We use a pseudo random key.
	- We start with a short key (e.g. 16 to 32 bytes)
	- We apply a pseudo random generate to the key → expand it into the desired length.
		- Output looks uniformly random, but is deterministic given the key.

![Untitled 5 51.png](../../attachments/Untitled%205%2051.png)

- **Problem:** there is no nonce → one key can only be used on one message
	- If the attacker has access to $c_1$﻿ and $c_2$﻿, they can retrieve the xor of the plaintexts.
	- Given the xor of the plaintexts (in English), you can recover the exact messages.

![Untitled 6 50.png](../../attachments/Untitled%206%2050.png)

## Block Cipher (AES, multi-use)

- A symmetric cipher that operates on fix-sized blocks.
	- The cipher is applied to $n$﻿-bit blocks of the plaintext.
- AES has variable key sizes → most companies use 256 bits (biggest key)

![Untitled 7 50.png](../../attachments/Untitled%207%2050.png)

- The block cipher is built by iteration.
	- We first take our key $k$﻿ and expand it into a bunch of keys $k_1, \dots, k_n$﻿
		- This might be with a pseudorandom generator, etc.
	- We take the message and iteratively apply the **round function** with different keys.
		- The round function is a primitive block cipher.
			- The round function tries to emulate a random function.
			- It is insecure on its own, but secure with iteration.
- For AES128, we iterative it 10 rounds to be secure. For AES256, we do 14 rounds.
	- Quirk: the last round of AES is different from all the other rounds → uses a different round function.
	- AES runtime scales linearly with the number of rounds.

![Untitled 8 50.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2050.png)

- AES is built into hardware on many platforms.
	- The `aes enc` executes one round of AES. In the last round, you use `aes enc last`
	- In modern machines, you implement AES by using these instructions.
- AES-NI is almost more secure because it prevents side-channel timing attacks.
	- If you implement in software, the running time of AES depends on the secret key.
	- Attackers can use side-channel timing attacks to find the key.

![Untitled 9 49.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2049.png)

- If you don’t have AES-NI implemented in hardware, the best software encryption is the stream cipher.
	- Most cheap android phones that don’t support AES use ChaCha20, using a library that implements it in constant time.

### Incorrect Use of Block Ciphers (ECB mode)

- If you want to encode a movie, the most natural thing to do is:
	- Break the movie into 16 byte blocks.
	- Encrypt each block into ciphertext.
	- **This is called ECB mode**
- ECB mode is very insecure:
	- If we have two blocks that are the same, the cipher text will be the same.
		- This leaks information about the plaintext to attackers.

![Untitled 11 48.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%2048.png)

### How to Use Block Ciphers (CTR mode)

- In this mode:
	- we choose a random nonce $IV$﻿
	- we break our message into the 16 byte blocks
	- we encrypt the nonce → $\texttt{AES}(k, IV)$﻿
		- this generates a random pad
	- we take the random pad and xor it with our message to get ciphertext
- Essentially, we are using AES itself as a pseudorandom generator.
- **Advantage:**
	- this allows us to encrypt in parallel → each block is independent of the other

![Untitled 12 48.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%2048.png)

- To decrypt this, we use the nonce to regenerate the pad `E(k, IV)`, and xor it with the cipher text.
	- Essentially, we are **only using AES encryption** to both encrypt the message and decrypt the message (in counter mode)
	- This is super similar to stream ciphers.

![Untitled 13 46.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%2046.png)

- If an attacker modified the cipher text, the decryptor would not know that it was modified.

# Message Integrity (MACs)

- MAC stands for message authentication code → basically means message integrity
	- Does not provide confidentiality.
- When Alice sends a message:
	- She generates a tag `S(k, m)` and attaches it to the message
		- This tag is like the signature of the message → cryptography checksum
	- Bob verifies the tag `V(k, m, tag)` using the shared key
		- This lets Bob know if the message was tampered

![Untitled 14 44.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2014%2044.png)

## HMAC (Hash-MAC)

- We typically build MACs using hash functions with HMAC.
- HMAC works like so:
	- We take our `msg` and prepend the key `k` to it.
	- We hash the result → `H(k xor ipad || msg)`
	- We then prepend the key to that hash → `H(k xor opad || H(k xor ipad || msg))`
	- Then we hash the result again.

![Untitled 15 42.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2015%2042.png)

- We assume H to be a cryptographic hash function where data is hashed by iterating a basic compression function on blocks of data.
	- We denote by B the byte-length of such blocks
	- The inner pad `ipad` = the byte 0x36 repeated B times
	- The outer pad `opad` = the byte 0x5C repeated B times.

# Authenticated Encryption: Combining MAC and ENC

- So far, we know:
	- encryption → provides confidentiality but no integrity
	- message integrity with MAC → provides integrity but no confidentiality.
- We now put them together to have both **confidentiality and integrity**
	- This is called **Authenticated Encryption**
- For the remainder, suppose we have an **encryption key** $k_E$﻿ **and a MAC key** $K_I$﻿

## SSL - Option 1

- This is a predecessor to TLS.
![Untitled 16 40.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2016%2040.png)
- To encrypt:
	1. We take message $m$﻿.
	2. We append a MAC to message $m$﻿
	3. We encrypt the entire message and MAC together.
- To decypt:
	1. We decrypt the cipher text.
	2. We then verify the MAC.
	3. If MAC is valid, we output the message.
- The issue with this is that the attacker can give you invalid ciphertext.
	- When you decrypt the ciphertext, it can lead to attacks (bc its unauthenticated data)

## TLS - Option 2
![Untitled 17 37.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2017%2037.png)
- To encrypt:
	1. We take message $m$﻿.
	2. We encrypt $m$﻿ to create ciphertext $c$﻿
	3. We compute a MAC on the ciphertext $c$﻿
	4. We append the MAC to the ciphertext.
- To decypt:
	1. We verify the MAC on the ciphertext.
	2. If MAC is valid, we decrypt the ciphertext.
	3. Then we output the plaintext.
- **TLS is the only one that is always correct → we first encrypt, then MAC**
	- Guarantees that you only decrypt on authenticated data

## SSH - Option 3
![Untitled 18 35.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2018%2035.png)
- To encrypt:
	1. We take message $m$﻿.
	2. We encrypt $m$﻿ to create ciphertext $c$﻿
	3. We compute a MAC on the message $m$﻿
	4. We append the MAC to the ciphertext.
- To decypt:
	1. We decrypt the cipher text.
	2. We verify the MAC with the plaintext.
	3. If MAC is valid, we output the plaintext.
- The issue with this is that the MAC might lead information about the message.

## AEAD
- When we apply encryption to a network packet, it typically has a header.
	- We **cannot encrypt this header** because it tells the router how to route the packet.
- We’d like to provide integrity for the header, but not encryption.
	- We only encrypt the payload of the packet.
- **Implementation:** The MAC is computed over the encrypted data + associated data.
	- Provides integrity for both encrypted data and associated data.
![Untitled 19 32.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2019%2032.png)

- The most common way to implement AEAD is using AES-GCM:
	1. counter mode encryption of payload with AES
	2. then compute MAC over all data
![Untitled 20 32.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2020%2032.png)
- Make sure the IV/nonce is different for each message.

# Summary

![Untitled 21 29.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2021%2029.png)

- If you only need integrity → use HMAC
- If you need confidentiality and integrity → use AES-GCM

# Section 2: Encryption and Compression Problems

- Encryption and compression are like oil and water → they don’t mix well
- But **HTTP** uses compression to reduce bandwidth and network traffic.

![Untitled 22 25.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2022%2025.png)
- Once you encrypt, the ciphertext looks like random data → random data is not very compressible.
![Untitled 23 23.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2023%2023.png)
- Compressing then encrypting causes security issues.
	- Eavesdroppers can see the compression ratio as a side-channel.
![Untitled 24 22.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2024%2022.png)

## Ex: the CRIME Attack
- An attacker can issue requests by making the user visit a malicious site.
	- The browser will attach cookies to the request, but attacker can’t read the cookie value.
		![Untitled 25 19.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2025%2019.png)

	- However, they can see the see the **size of the ciphertext**
		![Untitled 26 16.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2026%2016.png)
- This ciphertext size allows them to find the cookie!
	- There are 256 possible characters per letter of the cookie → they can brute force the cookie in a few minutes.
![Untitled 27 15.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2027%2015.png)
## What to Do?
- Disable compression ☹
	- This defeats the goal of reducing network traffic
- Use a different compression context for parts under Javascript control and parts that are not
	- Do LZW using different tables on different parts of the message.
	- **Problem:** this does not eliminate inherent leakage due to compression
- Change secret (Cookie) after every request
	- This prevents the CRIME attack → because cookie changes
	- When building authentication systems, make sure the cookie changes after every request.

# Section 3: Asymmetric/Public Key Cryptography

- The idea with this is that now, we have **many senders** and **one receiver**.

![Untitled 28 14.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2028%2014.png)

- Bob will generate a secret key `sk` for itself, and publish a public key `pk` that anyone can use to encrypt messages to Bob.
	- Called asymmetric because others encrypt with `pk`, while Bob decrypts with `sk`

![Untitled 29 13.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2029%2013.png)

## Building Block: Trapdoor Permutations

2. Algorithm `KeyGen`
	1. Generates and outputs the keys `pk` and `sk`
3. Algorithm `F(pk, ×)` : a one-way function
	1. Given a public key, takes any input `x` and outputs `y = F(pk, x)`
	2. One-way:
		1. Computing `y = F(pk, x)` is easy
		2. Given random `y`, finding `x` s.t. `y = F(pk,x)` is very difficult
4. Algorithm `F⁻¹(sk, x)`
	1. Invert `F(pk, ×)` using trapdoor `sk`
		1. If given the secret key, inverting the function becomes easy
	2. This mean `F⁻¹(sk, y) = x`

## Example: RSA
