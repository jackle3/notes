c# The Internet

- It’s just a really big global network that provides **best-effort** delivery of **packets** of data between connected hosts.
    - Most packets make it to their destination, but around 3% of packets get dropped.

  

- **Packet:** a structured sequence of bytes.
    - Header: metadata used by network
    - Payload: user data to be transported.

  

- Every host has a unique identifier — an IP address

  

- Series of routers received packets.
    
    - Each router looks at destination address on the header, and sends it one hop forwards towards the destination IP address.

## Network Protocols

- We define how hosts communicate in published network protocols
    - Network protocols are defined in RFCs, published on the internet.
- **Syntax**: How communication is structured (e.g., format and order of messages)
- **Semantics**: What communication means. Actions taken on transmit or receipt of message, or when a timer expires. What assumptions can be made

## Protocol Layering

![Untitled 2 53.png](attachments/Untitled%202%2053.png)

  

- These layers are defined in the OSI 5 Layer Model:
    
    - Note that data link is when two computers are physically connected (direct connection), while network is when they are not (indirect connection).
    
    ![Untitled 3 53.png](attachments/Untitled%203%2053.png)
    

  

- Below are abstractions at each layer.
    
    - Notice that IP is the only abstraction at the network layer.
    - Basically, the only thing necessary for stuff to work is that everyone speaks IP.

## Packet Encapsulation

- The packets of each layer are encapsulated inside the payload of lower layer packets.
    - Suppose Protocol N1 can use the services of lower layer protocol N2
        - A packet P1 of N1 is encapsulated into a packet P2 of N2
        - The payload of p2 is p1
        - The control information of p2 is derived from that of p1

  

![Untitled 5 52.png](attachments/Untitled%205%2052.png)

  

- This is what allows the higher layers to ignore how the lower layers work. They just shove themselves into the lower layer’s payload.

  

# Link Layer

- **Assumes**: Local nodes are physically connected
- **Task**: Transfer bytes between two hosts on the physically connected network
    - In other words, transfer bytes for the layer above it (network layer).

  

## Ethernet

- Most common Link Layer Protocol. Let’s you send packets to other local hosts.

![Untitled 6 51.png](attachments/Untitled%206%2051.png)

- In this layer, packets are called _**frames**_
    - Each physical machine has a MAC address: 6 bytes, universally unique.
    - The EtherType is used to communicate what protocol is in the payload.
        - `0x0800` is used to indicate **IPv4**
        - `0x0806` is used to indicate **ARP**
        - `0x86DD` is used to indicate **IPv6**

  

## Network Hub

- We have network hubs set up, where every machine is connected to the hub. This hub can be connected to more hubs.

![Untitled 7 51.png](attachments/Untitled%207%2051.png)

  

## Flooding

- When it receives a packet, it floods it to everyone else that it’s connected to.
    - This can include other hubs, which then flood it to more people.
- This is pretty inefficient → the machines have to spend time throwing away packets that were not meant for them.

  

## Switches

- These operate at the link layer, working with ethernet.
- It has some memory for a LUT that goes from `MAC address` to `Physical port`
- When a machine sends a packet, the switch can memorize what port it came from.
    - Example:
        - In the start, if MAC address `A` sends a packet to `B`, the switch will still flood it.
            - However, it now knows that `A` is connected through `Port 1`.
        - If `B` responds to `A`, the switch does not need to flood it.
            - It remembered that `A` was at `Port 1`, so it only sends it there.
            - It also now knows that `B` is on `Port 2`.

![Untitled 8 51.png](attachments/Untitled%208%2051.png)

- This is pretty memory inefficient → the lookup table might get extremely large.

  

# Network Layer

- This is how we transmit packets via indirect connections via IP addresses.

## Internet Protocol (IP)

- Internet Protocol (IP) defines what **packets that cross the Internet need to look like** to be processed by routers
- Every host is assigned a unique identifier (“IP Address”)
- Every packet has an IP header that indicates its source and destination IP addresses
- Routers forward packet along to try to get it to the destination host
- Rest of the packet should be ignored by the router

### IP Addresses

![Untitled 9 50.png](attachments/Untitled%209%2050.png)

### IPv4 Header

- Instruct routers and hosts what to do with a packet
- All values are filled in by the sending host

![Untitled 10 49.png](attachments/Untitled%2010%2049.png)

  

### What can IP do?

- Yes:
    - Routing. If host knows IP of destination host, route packet to it.
    - Fragmentation and reassembly: Split data into packets and reassemble
    - Error Reporting: (maybe, if you’re lucky) tell source it dropped your packet
- No:
    - Everything else.
        - No ordering. No retransmission. No (real) error checking. No acknowledgement of receipt. No “connections”. No security. **Just packets.**

  

## Network Layer Problems

- There are a few issues between link and network layer so far:
    - Local: How does a host know what MAC address their destination has given an IP address
    - Internet: How does each router know where to send each packet next?

  

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

- ARP is a Network protocol that lets hosts **map IP addresses to MAC addresses**
- Host who needs MAC address M corresponding to IP address N broadcasts an ARP packet to LAN asking, “who has IP address N?”
- Host that has IP address N will reply, “IP N is at MAC address M

  

### ARP Spoofing

- ARP has no security → whichever host replies first will be considered the correct ARP responder.
    - We reply on HTTPS to ensure authenticity, since ARP is insecure.
- Any host on the LAN can send ARP requests and replies.
    - **ARP spoofing**: any host can claim to be another host on the local network!
- This means any host `X` can force IP traffic between any two other hosts `A` and `B` to flow through `X`
    - Attacker `X` claims that `IP A` is at attacker’s MAC address `MAC X`
    - Attacker `X` claims that `IP B` is also at attacker’s MAC address `MAC X`
    - Attacker relays traffic addressed to `IP A` to `MAC A`, and vice versa, to preserve functionality.
- Attacker is now man-in-the-middle → can see all traffic.

  

## Autonomous Systems

- We give different organizations large chunks of IP addresses → using the prefix.
    - E.g. give `128.255.0.0/16` to represent `[128.255.0.0 - 128.255.255.255]`
- From here, you can simply route by doing prefix matching:
    - If a destination IP address matches the prefix, we can send it to whoever owns that range and have them route it.

  

- Autonomous systems are connected by their **border routers**.

![Untitled 11 49.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%2049.png)

  

- Each autonomous system has an ASN, a number that identifies them.
    - There are also Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that connect different autonomous systems. In this case, AT&T and NTT are ISPs.

![Untitled 12 49.png](attachments/Untitled%2012%2049.png)

  

### DNS

- When you join a network, the AS’s DNS server gives you some information:
    - It loans you an IP address to use
    - It tells you that the default gateway is the border router (e.g. `191.0.0.1`)
    - It tells you the network that you belong to (e.g. the prefix `191.0.0.0/16`)

  

### Routing (BGP)

- BGP: border gateway protocol
    - Runs on every border router.
    - Protocol that allows **routers to exchange information** about their routing tables
    - Lets you announce announce what IP addresses you have on the internet.
- Each router announces what it can route to all of its neighbors.
- Every router maintains a global table of routes.

  

- For example:
    
    ![Untitled 13 47.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%2047.png)
    
    - Google can make an annoucement to its neighbors about its range. It says that `AS5` can get to addresses `8.0.0.0/24`.
    - These neighbors can propagate this annoucement to its peers.
        - For neighbor `AS4`, it will say that `AS4, AS5` can get to `8.0.0.0/24`
        - For neighbor `AS6`, it will say that `AS6, AS5` can get to `8.0.0.0/24`
    - These new neighbors can then propagate this further.
        - For AT&T at `AS2`, it can say that `AS2, AS4, AS5` can get to `8.0.0.0/24`
    
      
    
    - Once it’s done propagating, Stanford now knows two paths to get a packet to Google.
        - It will choose the path `AS2, AS4, AS5`, because it needs to pass through less AS’s.
    
      
    
    - Note that if an AS receives two paths to the same destination, it will propagate the **shorter** one (e.g. `2,4,5: 8.0.0.0/24` and `3,2,4,5: 8.0.0.0/24` ).

  

### BGP Hijacking

- The BGP algorithm is based on each AS broadcasting its IP range.
    - If there are multiple paths to the same IP range, the router will pick the shortest path.
- An attacker can annouce and say that they have an IP range that they don’t own.

  

- In the example below:
    
    - Google actually has `8./24`.
    - However, the attacker also says that they have `8./24`.
    - Since the attacker is closer, Stanford’s border router will choose to route to the attacker.
    
    ![Untitled 14 45.png](attachments/Untitled%2014%2045.png)
    

  

- In the example below:
    - On 24 February 2008, Pakistan Telecom (AS 17557) began advertising a small part of YouTube’s (AS 36561) assigned network.
    - PCCW (AS 3491) did not validate Pakistan Telecom’s (AS 17557) advertisement for `208.65.153.0/24`
    - Youtube became offline.

  

- One solution is self detection and large mailing list:
    - E.g. Google will tell whoever owns AS4 to not accept the annoucement coming from AS11

  

- Another solution is by taking advantage of **longest prefix matching:**
    - Recall that in routing, it will always take the route with the longest prefix match, even if the path is longer.
    - Suppose Google advertises `8.8.0.0/16` and the attacker also advertises `8.8.0.0/16`.
        - Since the prefixes are the same, Stanford’s router will pick whichever one has the shorter path
        - If the attacker has a shorter path than Google, the attacker wins.
    - Fix: Google can also advertise `8.8.0.0/17` and `8.8.128.0/17`. The sum of these two prefixes is exactly `8.8.0.0/16`.
        - If you send this annoucement, Stanford will choose this, even if the path is longer, because the prefix is longer than the attacker.

  

# Transport Layer

- Recall that the Network/IP Layer provides:
    - Get packets (probably) to the right IP address
    - No security, No ordering, No correctness, No retransmission, No (real) error checking, No acknowledgement of receipt.
- The transport layer builds on top of IP to provide:
    - Reliable delivery
    - Get you to the right destination/service (e.g. web server)
- There are two options for the transport layer:
    - UDP
        - Does not provide reliable delivery, but will get you to the right service.
    - TCP
        - Identical port scheme to UDP.
        - Introduces reliable delivery and **streams of data**.

  

## Ports

- Each application on a host is identified by a port number
- TCP connection established between port A on host X to port B on host Y
    - Ports are 16-bit integers that specify the service (ie. 1–65535)
- Each process is allowed to claim a specific port number on the same IP address.
    
    ![Untitled 15 43.png](attachments/Untitled%2015%2043.png)
    

  

- Some destination port numbers used for specific applications by convention
    
    ![Untitled 16 41.png](attachments/Untitled%2016%2041.png)
    

  

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- A transport layer protocol that is essentially a wrapper around IP
- Adds ports to **demultiplex** traffic by application/service.
    - It also has an optional checksum.
- The UDP packet goes inside the payload of the IP packet, which goes inside the payload of the Ethernet frame.

![Untitled 17 38.png](attachments/Untitled%2017%2038.png)

  

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- Most applications want a stream of bytes delivered reliably and in-order between applications on different hosts.
- Despite IP packets being dropped, re-ordered, and duplicate, TCP provides…
    - Connection-oriented protocol with explicit setup/teardown
    - Reliable in-order byte stream
    - Congestion control

![Untitled 18 36.png](attachments/Untitled%2018%2036.png)

  

### Sequence Numbers

- Two data streams in a TCP session, one in each direction
    - Bytes in data stream numbered with a 32-bit sequence number
- Every packet has sequence number that indicates where data belongs
- Receiver sends acknowledgement number that indicates data received

![Untitled 19 33.png](attachments/Untitled%2019%2033.png)

  

### Acknowledgement Numbers

![Untitled 20 33.png](attachments/Untitled%2020%2033.png)

  

### ACKing Multiple Segments

- A sender can send a bunch of segments at once, and then receive an acknowledge for all (or some) of them.
    - This effectively allows them to send a whole window’s worth of segments → faster

![Untitled 21 30.png](attachments/Untitled%2021%2030.png)

![Untitled 22 26.png](attachments/Untitled%2022%2026.png)

  

### ACKing Dropped Segments

![Untitled 23 24.png](attachments/Untitled%2023%2024.png)

![Untitled 24 23.png](attachments/Untitled%2024%2023.png)

  

### Starting a Connection (Three Way Handshake)

- When we start a connection, the first **seqno** is a random place in the 32 bit integer space, and it wraps around.
    - This starting **seqno** is the ISN.
- Client sends SYN.
    - Says “Hey, I want to establish a connection on port `80`. My source port is `32942`, and I’ve chosen an ISN of `100`”
- Server responds with SYN + ACK.
    - Says “Hey, I received your SYN packet. I’ve chosen my own ISN of 200.”
- Client responds with ACK.
    - Says “Hey, I received your SYN + ACK packet.”

![Untitled 25 20.png](attachments/Untitled%2025%2020.png)

  

### Ending a Connection

- We have to do this three-way close to ensure that both sides have received all the data.

![Untitled 26 17.png](attachments/Untitled%2026%2017.png)

  

### Connection Reset

- TCP is designed to handle possibility of spurious TCP packets (e.g. from old connections)
    - However, if the state becomes so unsynchronized between client and server, either one can just give up and reset the connection.
- Packets that are invalid given the current state of session will generate a `reset`
    - If a connection exists, it is torn down
    - Packet with `RST` flag sent in response
- If a host receives a TCP packet with `RST` flag, it tears down the connection
