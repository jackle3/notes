# The processor

- Processors are part of the trusted computing base (see end of lecture 1)

![[attachments/Untitled 70.png|Untitled 70.png]]

- RDRAND → hardware-based random number generator.

# Intel SGX / TDX

- SGX stands for Software Guard eXtensions
- TDX stands for Trust Domain eXtensions

# 1. Enclave

- Fundamentally, we want to create an area on the processor where we can write secure code and memory, and no one can see what the processor is doing.
- There needs to also be encryption and authentication in memory

## Cloud computing

- We want to move data and VM to the cloud, but we don’t want the cloud server (e.g. hypervisor) to see the data.
    - The simple solution would be to encrypt it, but then the cloud server can’t do anything with the data.

### Solution: hardware enclave

- The cloud runs special hardware such that our jobs run on that hardware in a way that no one can see what its doing.

## Protecting keys

- Suppose we have a web server with keys. The server has a secret HTTPS key, and we don’t want anyone to get access to it.
    - To allow this, we place the key inside enclave code using SGX.
    - Then, if we need to use the key to decrypt, the unprotected code can call the enclave code to ask it to decrypt → it can’t extract the key.

![[attachments/Untitled 4 36.png|Untitled 4 36.png]]

## How does Intel SGX work?

- An application can define part of itself as an enclave.
    - When it does so, it will create an isolated portion of memory (the enclave bits of the page table will turn on, preventing unauthorized access)

![[attachments/Untitled 5 36.png|Untitled 5 36.png]]

- The web server will then load whatever code it wants into the enclave.
- Then, it will call some `TrustedFunc` on the enclave → the enclave code will write into enclave memory.

![[attachments/Untitled 6 35.png|Untitled 6 35.png]]

- In terms of the process memory, it’s a fully isolated part of it → encrypted in RAM.

![[attachments/Untitled 7 35.png|Untitled 7 35.png]]

## New instructions for enclave

- Note that the enclave code itself might not be secret → we only want to keep the data that the code generates a secret.
    - You first call `ECREATE` to establish the memory region for the enclave.
    - Then call `EADD` to copy in memory pages (code) into the enclave.
    - Then, as you copy, you call `EEXTEND` in order to hash the enclave contents.
    - Then, call `EINIT` to verify that the hash of all the enclave code is properly signed by the enclave owner.

![[attachments/Untitled 8 35.png|Untitled 8 35.png]]

- Only assembly instructions in the enclave can access the enclave data.

# 2. Attestation

- The machine proves that its running an enclave, and proves what code is running in the enclave.
    - This is how you send secret data to the enclave.

![[attachments/Untitled 9 34.png|Untitled 9 34.png]]

- How does the remote server whether it should give the enclave its data?
    1. The enclave generates a public key `pk` and a secret key `sk`
    2. Then, it will send the `pk` and a `report` to another enclave (**Intel’s app enclave**)
        1. The `report` contains the hash of the code in the enclave.
    3. The **Intel’s app enclave** then sends that to the **Intel’s quoting enclave**.
        1. The quoting enclave has a secret signing key.
    4. The quoting enclave signs the `pk` and the `report`, creating a certificate and giving it back to the enclave.
    5. That certificate then gets sent to the server, which verifies all the signatures.
        1. The server learns that the `pk` is associated with the enclave, and it learns the hash of the code in the enclave.
    6. The server can then ask the cloud to find the code associated with the hash.
        1. It will have to look at it to determine if it trusts it.
    7. The server will then send its data to the enclave, encrypted using the enclave’s `pk`
        1. The only thing that can decrypt the cipher text `E(pk, data)` is the enclave, since it has the secret key `sk`

# 3. SGX Summary

![[attachments/Untitled 10 33.png|Untitled 10 33.png]]

- SGX code is not as fast as regular code, because it has to encrypt and decrypt all memory operations → it thinks that memory is untrusted.
- SGX was not that much of a success because it’s not suitable for legacy applications.
    - For applications like web servers, we have to split it into an untrusted part and a trusted part → some parts get the key, some don’t.
    - This was pretty unfriendly for developers, hard to write code for it.

# 4. TDX

- Basically a much easier to use enclave.
    - Instead of breaking up parts of the application and putting it in the enclave, just put the **entire application in the enclave.**

![[attachments/Untitled 11 33.png|Untitled 11 33.png]]

- Protects the enclave from the rest of the system, but not from itself.
    - If there is a bug in the web server, it might lead to the secret key being compromised.
- Lower security than SGX because the attack surface is much bigger (the entire application, as opposed to just part of it)
    - SGX isolates a portion of the process memory.
    - TDX isolates the entire VM from the rest of the system → isolated memory for VM.

# Example of enclave: federated data

- Suppose we have two hospitals with their own datasets, and we want to run analysis on the union of the datasets.
- We can use this thing called Multi-party computation (MPC) → cryptographic solution.
    
    - This works for simple computations, but its not efficient.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 12 33.png|Untitled 12 33.png]]
    
- To run this process at speed, we can use an enclave.
    
    - We can find a cloud provider with a machine that supports enclave.
    - The machine will generate a `pk` and `sk` and a certificate, then send the `pk` and certificate to the hospitals.
        - The certificate attests to what the enclave code contains.
    - The hospitals can send the data as encrypted ciphertext to the enclave.
    - The enclave can then run analysis on the data, output the results, then destroy the data.

# SGX insecurities

- Since the attacker controls the OS, they can see a lot of **side-channel information.**
    
    1. They can’t see memory, but they can see what pages are being asked for and what are being written to.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 14 30.png|Untitled 14 30.png]]
    
- Attackers can also **extract quoting keys**.
    
    - Intel’s quoting key is stored in the Intel enclave → different for each machine.
    - However, if an attacker can steal an `sk` from some machine, they can use that quoting enclave to attest to arbitrary non-enclave code from other machines.

# The Spectre attack

- We now shift focus to an attack caused by the tradeoff between speed and security in hardware.
- Since 2004, there has not been much change in the processor speed itself.
    
    - Correspondingly, memory latency has not improved much either
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 16 28.png|Untitled 16 28.png]]
    
- How is it that processors are still getting faster?
    
    - Because we are putting more things in them to do more per cycle.
    - We introduced **caches** to reduce memory delays → most of the processor space is devoted to caches.
        - This makes it so that we don’t have to run to memory every time we need to reach something; simply read from cache for frequent data.
    - We introduced **speculative execution** to avoid computational delays.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 17 25.png|Untitled 17 25.png]]
    

# 1. Memory caches

- We describe a 4-way associative cache → 4 addresses in each bucket/cache set.
- The orange and blue rectangles are the processor → we have CPU and cache.

![[attachments/Untitled 18 23.png|Untitled 18 23.png]]

- Suppose the CPU wants to find an address from memory.
    1. It figures out what bucket the address would be in the cache.
    2. It asks the bucket if that address is in there.
        1. If it is, then the cache returns that address, and it’s a very fast operation.
        2. If it isn’t, we have to go to main memory, and it’s a slow operation.
            1. We ask for the data at the address from main memory.
            2. Once we have it, since our bucket is full, we have to evict one of the addresses from the bucket and store it in the cache.
                1. For example, we can evict the least recently used address.
- If the CPU needs an address that has been accessed recently, then it’s extremely fast because it’s already in the cache.

# 2. Speculative execution

- Consider the program below.
    
    - In order to get the `uncached_value` to check the if-statement, it might take a few hundred cycles to load it from memory.
    - To increase performance, it will use a **branch predictor**
        - For every branch address, remembers whether the branch is usually taken or not
            - (e.g. for a for-loop, the branch that takes it back to the beginning of the loop will be taken most times).
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 19 20.png|Untitled 19 20.png]]
    
- The program can save a lot of time if it just starts running `compute(b)` while its waiting to get `uncached_value` from memory.
    
    - If the if-statement fails, then we simply throw it away.
    - If it succeeds, then we’ve saved a lot of time because we began computation already.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 20 20.png|Untitled 20 20.png]]
    

## Architectural Guarantee

- Even though the guarantee is that the resulting registers will match in-order execution, there can be **observable side effects** of the speculative instructions.

![[attachments/Untitled 21 17.png|Untitled 21 17.png]]

- The side effect is that **the cache will change** → might cause evictions in the cache that changes the state of the cache unexpectedly.

## Variant 1: Conditional branch attack

- The code below guarantees that we will never exceed the bounds of `array1` → safe

![[attachments/Untitled 22 13.png|Untitled 22 13.png]]

- In the diagram below, pink means uncached and yellow means cached.
    - First:
        - We want `array1_size` to not be in the cache.
        - We want the memory at 1000 bytes away from `array1` to be in the cache.
        - We will train the branch predictor to always take the `if`

![[attachments/Untitled 23 12.png|Untitled 23 12.png]]

- Now, we will read at `x=1000`, which would execute speculatively while waiting for size.
    - This will read the secret byte, which returns fast because its in the cache.

![[attachments/Untitled 24 11.png|Untitled 24 11.png]]

- Then, since the returned byte was `array1[1000] = 09`, it will read `array2[09 * 4096]` and put that in the cache.
    - Eventually, `array1_size` will return from memory, and the speculative work will be discarded (but the `array2[9 * 4096]` stays in the cache)

![[attachments/Untitled 25 8.png|Untitled 25 8.png]]

- Then, the attacker will try to read entries from `array2` and measure the time.
    - The uncached reads will be very slow because it needs to find from memory.
    - But the cached read at `i = 09` will be fast because its already cached → this reveals the secret byte.
        - The attacker now knows that `array1 base + 1000` is the byte `09`.

![[attachments/Untitled 26 7.png|Untitled 26 7.png]]

## Variant 2: indirect branches

- Indirect branches allows the processor to `jmp` to an address stored in a register.
    - We can train the branch predictor to mis-predict to a gadget that the attacker wants.
    - If the last 10 times `jmp[rax]` was called, it jumped to address `0x1000`, then the branch predictor will predict and do speculative execution there as well.
