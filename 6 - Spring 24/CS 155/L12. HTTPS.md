# Lecture Goals

- **Brief overview of HTTPS:**
	- How the SSL/TLS protocol works (very briefly)
	- How to use HTTPS

- **Integrating HTTPS into the browser**
	- Lots of user interface problems to watch for

- HTTPS is basically HTTP on top of TLS.

# Threat Model: Network Attacker

- The attacker we’re defending against is a **network** adversary.

- Network Attacker:
	- Controls network infrastructure: Routers, DNS
	- Eavesdrops, injects, blocks, and modifies packets

- Examples:
	- Wireless network at Internet Café
	- Internet access at hotels (untrusted ISP)

- Using HTTPS, even a network adversary (who controls the infra) cannot mess with you.

# TLS Overview

## 1. Diffie-Hellman Key exchange

- This makes it **secure against** **eavesdropping****.**

![[attachments/Untitled 83.png|Untitled 83.png]]

- The DH key exchange is a key part of TLS.
	- The browser and server have never met before.
	- They send messages to one another, and at the end, they both have a shared key.
	- An attacker eavesdropping will not learn anything about the key.

- The protocol operates in a finite cyclic group.
	- Contains all the powers of some element $g$﻿.
	- The power is done modulo $q$﻿.

![[attachments/Untitled 1 50.png|Untitled 1 50.png]]

- We have browser and server, and each chooses a random number $a, b \in \{1, \dots, q\}$﻿
	- Browser Alice sends $A = g^a$﻿ → only browser knows the exponent $a$﻿
	- Server Bob sends $B = g^b$﻿ → only server knows the exponent $b$﻿

![[attachments/Untitled 2 50.png|Untitled 2 50.png]]

- Then, they can set up a shared key by computing $g^{ab}$﻿
	- Browser Alice knows $a$﻿ and receives $B$﻿, so she computes $B^a$﻿
	- Server Bob knows $b$﻿ and receives $A$﻿, so she computes $A^b$﻿
	- This shared key is called a **pre master secret (PMS)**

![[attachments/Untitled 3 50.png|Untitled 3 50.png]]

- An eavesdropping adversary knows:
	- $g$﻿ → public info
	- $A$﻿ → eavesdropped Browser Alice
	- $B$﻿ → eavesdropped Server Bob
	- However, it cannot compute $g^{ab}$﻿ → it can only compute $g^{a + b}$﻿
		- This is the Diffie-Hellman assumption

## 2. Digital Signatures

- This makes it **secure against** **tampering****.**
- We create a digital signature that depends on the contents of document.

- The signature scheme has three algorithms:

	- `Gen()` → creates public and secret key for Alice.
	- `Sign(sk, msg)` → Alice signs the message using the secret key.
	- `Verify(pk, msg, sig)` → Others verify the message using Alice’s public key.

	![[attachments/Untitled 4 49.png|Untitled 4 49.png]]

- This signature is secure:

	![[attachments/Untitled 5 49.png|Untitled 5 49.png]]

## 3. Certificates

- This is the main application of signatures → use signatures to certify public keys.

- If Alice wants to talk to Bob, how does she get Bob’s public key?

![[attachments/Untitled 6 48.png|Untitled 6 48.png]]

- To solve problem, introduced a **certificate authority** → trusted to authenticate individuals.
	- The public key of the certificate authority is preloaded into the OS.
	- The OS (e.g. Microsoft, Google, Apple ) decides which CA’s to trust.

- Here’s how the exchange works:
	1. Bob first sends its public key and proof of identity to the CA.
		- Proof of identity might be legal documents, etc.
	2. The CA gives Bob a certificate → certifies that Bob’s private key is valid.
	3. When Bob talks to Alice, Alice can verify Bob’s certificate.
		1. She will use the CA’s public key to verify the certificate.

![[attachments/Untitled 7 48.png|Untitled 7 48.png]]

- Typically, the certificate is used for an extended period of time (e.g. one year).

### Sample Certificate

![[attachments/Untitled 8 48.png|Untitled 8 48.png]]

### Common Name on Certificates

- The certificate will list the common name (i.e. domain name) of the server.
	- The server needs to match the common name, otherwise the certificate is invalid.

- Typically, people use explicit names for their certificates.
- If you have a lot of subdomains, you can buy one wildcart certificate for all of them.

![[attachments/Untitled 9 47.png|Untitled 9 47.png]]

### Certificate Authorities

- There are a lot of certificate authorities in the world.
	- This might lead to issues with improper certificate issuance!

![[attachments/Untitled 10 46.png|Untitled 10 46.png]]

## 4. TLS 1.3 Session Setup

- One of the key components of TLS is the TLS handshake.
	- (before TLS 1.3) There are four round trips that it has to do before we can send data.
		1. ClientHello from client to server
		2. ServerHello and Verify from server to client
		3. Finished from client to server
		4. And both have to compute the session keys.

![[attachments/Untitled 11 46.png|Untitled 11 46.png]]

1. The first message is the `ClientHello` message
	1. This contains a random nonce and a KeyShare.
		1. The KeyShare value is the DH message (i.e. $g^a$﻿)

2. The server responds with the `ServerHello` message
	1. This contains a random nonce, a KeyShare, and an **encrypted** certificate.
	2. Before it sends `ServerHello`, the server can pick $g^b$﻿ and compute the shared key.
		1. It uses this key to encrypt the certificate.

1. The server also sends the `CertVerify` message.
	1. This message contains a signature of all the data that has been sent so far.
	2. This signature proves to the client that the server is indeed the intended server.
	3. This is why the nonce is necessary → ensures signature is different per session.

2. Once the client receives `ServerHello`,
	1. It computes $g^{ab}$﻿ to get the shared key.
	2. It then uses that to **decrypt** the certificate and verify it.
	3. It can also call `Verify(pk_server, data, signature_server)` to verify the signature.

3. Once they are done, they can both compute the shared session key.
	1. This is the hash of $g^{ab}$﻿ and the two nonces.
	2. They can then use this shared session key to encrypt HTTP traffic.

- The certificate is encrypted to hide the domain name → protect privacy.
	- Cloud computing multiplexes the same IP address across many domain names.
	- E.g. If we connect to Google cloud, the IP address will tell attackers that we’re connecting to Google Cloud, but they can’t know what domain we are connecting to.

- **Most common way to use TLS** is: server blindly authenticates to the client who they are.
	- The server does not know who the client is.
	- The client needs to log in and authenticate themselves for the server to know.

- But TLS does have a mode where it can do mutual authentication.

### Optimization

- In TLS 1.3, they added a shortcut called the `0-RTT data`.
	- Effectively, the browser can send its GET request already with the `ClientHello`.
	- This data is encrypted with a pre-shared key (i.e. browser already connected and established shared key with server before).

![[attachments/Untitled 12 46.png|Untitled 12 46.png]]

- An issue with this optimization is that the `0-RTT data` can be replayed.
	- An attacker can record the ClientHello and replay it later.
	- As such, make sure data has no side effects.
- Once way that the server can prevent replay is to:
	- Remember all the nonces of CilentHellos that it has seen.
	- However, this is bad because the server has to remember a lot of nonces → not scalable.

# HTTPS: Integrating TLS with HTTP

- HTTP/2: There are a lot of requests going back and forth before connection works
	- TLS is built on top of TCP.
	- TCP has its own three-way handshake to set up the connection.
	- TLS has its own handshake to set up the security.
- HTTP/2: A custom protocol that **encrypts by default**, integrating the handshakes.
	- Adopts a protocol called QUIC that sandwiches TCP and TLS together.
	- Performs both the TCP and TLS handshakes in one → QUIC handshake.
	- Loses modularity (i.e. multiple layers) but gains performance (i.e. less handshakes).

## Virtual Hosting

- Virtual hosting: many sites hosted at same IP address
- There is an **issue** when we have multiple domains on the same server IP address.

	- When we send the server the `client-hello`, we only specify the `nonce`, `KeyShare`, and the IP address of the server.
		- The web server **does not know** **what domain name** the client wants to reach.
	- When it tries to send back the `server-cert`, it does not know what certificate to send.
		- There is one certificate per domain, but many domains per IP address.

	![[attachments/Untitled 14 42.png|Untitled 14 42.png]]

- The solution since TLS 1.1 (2003) was **Server Name Indication (SNI)**
	- Allows client to specify the domain name it is trying to reach
		- `client_hello_extension: server_name=cnn.com`

- The issue is that SNI defeats the privacy benefit of encrypting the certificate in TLS 1.3
	- Recall that we encrypted the certificate so that an eavesdropper does not know what domain the client is connecting to.
	- Solution: we also encrypt `client_hello` (ECH protocol)
		- Since the `client_hello` is the first message between browser and server, there is no shared key set up yet.
		- As such, we encrypt it using a public key that is **embedded in the server DNS.**
			- E.g. when you try to connect to `cnn.com`, you look up its IP address in DNS.
				- DNS takes the domain name and gives you the IP address.
				- As part of the response, it also gives the public key of `cnn.com`.
		- The server can decrypt this `client_hello` using its secret key.

## Modern Web Traffic

- Today, we basically use HTTPS for all web traffic.
- In the past, people would not encrypt because **crypto slows down web servers**.
	- E.g. Ad servers don’t want to encrypt their ads because it adds CPU overhead.
	- This is no longer true thanks to AES-NI.

# HTTPS in the Browser

## TLS Indicator

![[attachments/Untitled 16 39.png|Untitled 16 39.png]]

- **Intended Goal:**
	- Provide user with identity of page origin
	- Indicate to user that page contents were not viewed or modified by a network attacker

- The indicator is displayed when:
	- All elements on the page fetched using HTTPS
	- For all elements:
		- HTTPS cert issued by a CA trusted by browser
		- HTTPS cert is valid (e.g. not expired)
		- Domain in URL matches: `CommonName` or `SubjectAlternativeName` in cert

			- The `SubjectAlternativeName` allows you to list many additional domains in a single certificate → useful for large companies.

			![[attachments/Untitled 17 36.png|Untitled 17 36.png]]

- **Security Indicators**
	- Positive security indicator → show indicator only when page is secure.
		- The problem with this is that people don’t know where to look for them.
	- Negative security indicator → show indicator only when page is not secure.
		- Note: always use negative indicators!

- Until last year, the TLS indicator was a lock → positive security indicator.

	- If the lock was there, it shows that the site is secure.
	- However, positive security indicators are dangerous!
		- In the below, the page [`paypal.login.com`](http://paypal.login.com) renders the page `paypal.com`
		- The inner page shows that it is secure, but the outer page is not secure.
		- Users will see the lock in the inner page and think they’re safe.

# Problems with HTTPS

## 1. Upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS

- Generally, web servers will redirect requests over HTTP to HTTPS.
- However, attackers can try to prevent this upgrade → SSL_strip attack.
- Suppose the user is connected by HTTP to a malicious access point (e.g. user connects to a cafe wifi access point)
	1. The attacker connects to the server over TLS and gets the response page.
	2. They decrypt the response, and send it over HTTP to the client.
	3. Whenever the user clicks a link or makes a request, the attacker will strip the SSL security from the request.
- In other words:
	- Because the user connected to the bank over HTTP originally, the attacker can keep the user permanently on HTTP, even though the bank is trying to upgrade them to HTTPS.

![[attachments/Untitled 19 31.png|Untitled 19 31.png]]

- This attack was difficult to detect because of a UI design flaw in old browsers.
	- Users could not detect that the site was not secure.
	- Even if we used negative indicators, the user might just ignore it.

### Defense: HSTS

![[attachments/Untitled 20 31.png|Untitled 20 31.png]]

- The server sends a **HSTS header** that tells the browser to always connect over HTTPS.
	- When you go to [`bank.com`](http://bank.com) from home, the browser gets this header and remembers this.
		- It stores this header in the same place that it stores cookies.
	- When you go to [`bank.com`](http://bank.com) from an unsafe access point, if it tries to connect over HTTP, the browser will refuse.
	- **This is a TOFU model**
- Subsequent visits must be over HTTPS (self signed certs result in an error)
	- Browser **refuses to connect over HTTP** or if site presents an invalid cert
	- Requires that entire site be served over valid HTTPS
- HSTS improves security but harms privacy, because HSTS is like cookies → allows server to track you.
	- HSTS flag deleted when user “clears private data”.

- Traditionally There is a **HSTS preload list.**
	- Preload list is hard-coded in Chrome source code.
	- When you download Chrome, it has a list of domains that it knows only speaks HTTPs.
		- Allows you to also get the HSTS header without having to connect to the site.

### CSP: Upgrade-insecure-requests

![[attachments/Untitled 21 28.png|Untitled 21 28.png]]

## 2. Forged Certificates

- This happens when a CA **issues a wrong certificate**.

![[attachments/Untitled 22 24.png|Untitled 22 24.png]]

### Man in the Middle Attacks

- If someone accidentally wrongly issues a `gmail` certificate, **this is very dangerous.**
	- When you send a request to another country, it will go through the border router.
	- Suppose this border router was malicious and had a **rogue certificate**.
	- When the server sends you its certificate, the border can replace the real certificate with the rogue certificate.
		- This is a perfectly valid certificate because it was issued by a CA.
- When you set up the TLS connection:

	- Your TLS connection is with the attacker. The attacker relays this with another TLS connection to the bank.
	- The attacker can now read and modify all of your data.

	![[attachments/Untitled 23 22.png|Untitled 23 22.png]]

- In other words:
	- When the browser tries to set up a connection with `bank.com`…
	- It actually sets up a connection with the attacker, because it thinks the attacker is [`bank.com`](http://bank.com) because it had a valid certificate.
	- The attacker sets up another connection to the actual [`bank.com`](http://bank.com), in order to get the functionality of `bank.com` to work.

### Solutions

1. Public-key pinning (static pins)
	- Hardcode list of allowed CAs for certain sites (Gmail, facebook, …)
		- E.g. the certificate for `gmail` is only issues by the Google CA.
	- Browser rejects certs issued by a CA not on list.
		- E.g. when Chrome sees a wrongly issued cert for `gmail`, it will notify Google.

2. Certificate Transparency (CT)
	- Idea: CA’s must advertise a log of all certificates they issued
	- Browser will only use a cert if it is published on (two) log servers
		- Server attaches to certificate a signed statement from log (SCT)
	- Companies can scan logs to look for invalid issuance of certificates for their site.
		- Makes sure that all certificates for your site were requests by you.

## 3. Mixed Content

- This occurs when there are HTTP and HTTPS content on same page

![[attachments/Untitled 25 18.png|Untitled 25 18.png]]

![[attachments/Untitled 26 15.png|Untitled 26 15.png]]

## 4. Does HTTPS Hide Web Traffic?

- Problems: traffic analysis, compression attacks.
