# Bitbar

- Has login, user register, transfer, profile functionalities.

## Web server

- Every time we navigate to a page, it will send a request to the server for the page.
    - Recall that `GET` is a stateless request (no state on server is changed)
    - The path is like `/login` → where you are on page

## Starter code

## What powers Bitbar?

1. Node: a runtime environment/platform for running JavaScript code
2. ExpressJS: a web application framework, written in JS and runs on Node → sets up the web server.
3. SQLite: a lightweight database that is embedded into the program.
4. EJS: a templating language for generating HTML → HTML where we can also run JS.

## Creating HTML with EJS

- There are `render` function calls inside `router.js`
    - Could maybe use this to insert HTML onto the page.

## Handling Requests with Express

- Every time the server gets a request that matches a route, it will hit the route on Express and run the code inside it → in this case, it renders the EJS template.
    - The handler parameters are the request `req` and the response `res` → we can do things to `res`, such as call the render stuff above, in order to change the response.

## Cookies with Express

- Used to keep track of the session when the user visits and logs into the site.
    - “Reminds” the server of who they are talking to.
- Bitbar uses cookies for sessions, and also saves a lot of information in them.
- The client’s browser can view and alter the cookie via `document.cookie`
- You can access cookies in Express using `req.session`
    - This is how the browser/server sees what cookies were sent in the request.

## XHMLHttpRequest

- This allows us to make our own requests manually.
    - The code below sets up an HTTP request and sends it.
- The `withCredentials` field makes sure that the cookies are sent in requests.
- The `req.send()` is async → we return from it before the send actually finishes.
    - There is no guarantee that the sending is completed and the server has responded after `req.send()` returns.
    - We can use `req.onload` instead → code inside function only runs after send completes and server has responded.

## HTTP GET Requests

- Parameters of the GET request are placed in the URL as search queries.
    - Recall that GET does not have a body (usually).
- From the webserver, Express will put the parameters in `req.query`

## HTTP POST Requests

- Recall that POST requests get a body.
    - As such, you can put parameters in the URL or in the body of the request (useful for complicated parameters like objects).
- From the webserver perspective, Express will put the parameters in `req.body`
- The code below is an example of sending a POST request from the **web browser**.

# Attacks Intro

## Cookie Tampering

- You can access (and change) the cookie with `document.cookie` in the JS console

## XSS (Cross site scripting)

- This is a **code injection attack** → construct input such that it injects code, so that it gets executed on the system’s browser.
    - We need to escape the context → notice that the user input a closing `h1` tag first to escape the context and run the script.

![[attachments/Untitled 10 50.png|Untitled 10 50.png]]

- There are two types of XSS attacks:
    - **Reflected XSS:** Eve sends Alice a malicious link that when Alice follows runs code in Alice’s browser
    - **Stored XSS:** Eve saves some data to a page on a website. When Alice visits that page, Eve’s code runs

## CSRF (Cross site request forgery)

- Takes advantage of cookies and their same-origin policy.
    
    - Cookies are sent based on **who the request is being sent to** rather than **who sent the request**.
    - In this example, the senders are different but the origin (e.g. they receiver) is same.
        - The cookies are sent in the requests of all three senders.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 11 50.png|Untitled 11 50.png]]
    
- This can be exploited!!
    
    - Alice has visited [`bank.com`](http://bank.com) and has the session cookie.
        - When she visits [`attacker.com`](http://attacker.com) and it makes a request to `bank.com`, her cookie will be sent → allows unauthorized access.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 12 50.png|Untitled 12 50.png]]
    
    - Because of SOP, the attacker can’t read the response from `bank.com`. However, it can still send requests to `bank.com`

## SQL Injection

- In the example below, the input is fine. There are no context escapes, and it will execute normally.

![[attachments/Untitled 13 48.png|Untitled 13 48.png]]

- In the example below, there is SQL injection.
    - Notice that the `'` will escape the string context of `'$u'`
    - Then, the `--` will comment out the remainder of the line.
        - Allows us to select the `id` without even looking at the password, giving us access.

# Tips

- Use `option + cmd + I` to access the developer tools.
    - The important tabs are Inspector, Console, and Network

  

- The **Network** tab looks like this:
    
    - Notice that it made a request to `login` to load the page.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 15 44.png|Untitled 15 44.png]]
    
    - When we log into the website, we’ll see a request that logs in the user → sends username and password as plaintext in the URL parameters
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 16 42.png|Untitled 16 42.png]]
    

  

- The **Inspector** tab allows us to see the HTML of the page.
    
    - Useful for code injection and cross site scripting attacks → lets you find the context of the page and how to break out of it.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 17 39.png|Untitled 17 39.png]]
    

  

- The **Console** tab lets you run arbitrary JS code → including accessing the DOM.
    
    - You can edit the cookie by doing `document.cookie = ...`
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 18 37.png|Untitled 18 37.png]]
    

  

- The **Storage** tab is another way to access the cookie → this is where you can delete the cookie.
