# Conceptualizing vulnerabilities and exploits

- When we think about a program, we can think of it as a finite state machine.
    - The program is in different states over time, and different actions change which state the program is in.
        - E.g. when the user clicks on a link, we go to another state with the page on that link
- The state machine below is just a simplified abstract that makes it easier for us to think about.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 1 44.png|Untitled 1 44.png]]
    
- When we write code, the state machine is a lot more complicated with a lot more states.
    
    - To load a page, you need to do a lot of tasks in between. Each of these tasks is a state.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 2 44.png|Untitled 2 44.png]]
    
- **Bugs** occur when there are reachable states in the runnable state machine (the code) that have no corresponding state in the intended state machine (the design).
    
    - The runnable state machine might have states that have no analogue to the original.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 3 44.png|Untitled 3 44.png]]
    
    - E.g. there was no conceptual analogue for buffer overflow in the intended design, but it is a reachable state on the CPU.

## Classifying states

![[attachments/Untitled 4 43.png|Untitled 4 43.png]]

1. Most states are intended states → what we intended for the system to operate.
2. There are also transition states → states that are necessary to perform our actions.
    1. States that help in simulating atomicity with non-atomic operations.
    2. E.g. To save a file, it might not be atomic: there can be states where only half the file is saved, then we transition to having the full file saved → this halfway point is a transition state.
3. Finally, there are unintended states → bugs, etc.

## State space in memory

- How many states are there?
    
    - For each bit in memory, its value can lead us to a different space.
    - With 16GB of memory, the number of states is:
        
        $2^{16 \text{ GB}} = 2^{(16 \text{ GB}) (1024 \text{ MB per GB})( 1024 \text{ KB per MB}) ( 1024 \text{ bytes per KB})} = 2^{17179869184 \text{ bytes}}$
        
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 5 43.png|Untitled 5 43.png]]
    
- We can look at the execution of the program in state space, where each node/circle is a configuration of bits in memory.
    
    - Each CPU instruction is transitioning between one state in memory to another state.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 6 42.png|Untitled 6 42.png]]
    
- We can quotient out the `ASLR` slide of memory.
    
    - However, in most cases, the state space is still far too large to manually explore.

# Fuzzing

![[attachments/Untitled 10 40.png|Untitled 10 40.png]]

- Fuzzing explores a large part of the state space compared to manual analysis, and a very different portion of the state space than what humans tend to reason about when reading code.

## Example

- This is a basic example: take 512 bytes of random data, shove it into a JPEG file, and open the file to see what happens.

![[attachments/Untitled 11 40.png|Untitled 11 40.png]]

## Common fuzzing strategies

![[attachments/Untitled 12 40.png|Untitled 12 40.png]]

- There are some ways we can make the example above better:
    - **Mutation:** We could get real JPEG files, and randomly change bytes to try to corrupt it.
    - **Generation:** We can look at the spec for JPEGs and implement a JPEG generator that has valid headers.
    - **Coverage:** We can look at the JPEG parser and select for examples that get deeper and deeper.
        - This is what’s happening on Part 3 of the project.

# Mutation-based fuzzing

![[attachments/Untitled 13 38.png|Untitled 13 38.png]]

## Example

- This method works very well on a project that has not been fuzzed before, since all of the bugs that the dumb fuzzer can catch are still there.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 14 36.png|Untitled 14 36.png]]
    

## Advantages and Limitations

- It’s a good idea to start off with mutation-based fuzzing to catch all the low-hanging fruit, while you do research into further vulnerabilities.

# Generation-based fuzzing

![[attachments/Untitled 16 34.png|Untitled 16 34.png]]

## Example: `syzkaller`

- Fuzzes the operating system kernel to look for vulnerabilities in system calls.

![[attachments/Untitled 17 31.png|Untitled 17 31.png]]

## Advantages and Limitations

![[attachments/Untitled 18 29.png|Untitled 18 29.png]]

- You’re unlikely to find anything in mature systems:
    - Linux and Android has already been heavily fuzzed by things like `syzkaller`.

# Coverage guided fuzzing

## american fuzzy lop (AFL)

![[attachments/Untitled 20 26.png|Untitled 20 26.png]]

## Advantages and Limitations

- It can learn how to generate things using code coverage as a metric.

![[attachments/Untitled 21 23.png|Untitled 21 23.png]]

## Fuzzing Example: Samsung Qmage

- Mateusz Jurczyk exploited Qmage, an image codec included on Samsung phones.
    - It was reachable via zero-click MMS → when you send an image to a user, the phone automatically calls Qmage to parse the image **without any user input.**
        - The red flag was that **it was not hard to get on the zero-click path**.
- After decompiling it with a disassembler:
    - The code looks fragile but the library is closed source
    - Very few examples of Qmage files
    - Mateusz developed a harness to enable large-scale coverage-guided fuzzing of the Qmage codec

### Harness

- You can fuzz at scale by using emulators and virtual machines.

![[attachments/Untitled 22 19.png|Untitled 22 19.png]]

### Coverage

- After roughly a month of fuzzing at scale, they were able to get significant coverage across all the main functions of interest.
- To measure code coverage, they traced the address of the instruction pointers.

![[attachments/Untitled 23 18.png|Untitled 23 18.png]]

### Results

- There were 5218 unique crashes, where an estimated 10% of vulnerabilities were exploitable.

![[attachments/Untitled 24 17.png|Untitled 24 17.png]]

- In the end result, they were able to get a remote root shell using the vulnerability.

# Dynamic Analysis

- Valgrind is an example of a dynamic analysis tool → runs your code in order to automatically find errors in it.

![[attachments/Untitled 27 12.png|Untitled 27 12.png]]

## AddressSanitizer (ASan)

- This program is run very often in large memories, it’s a form of dynamic analysis.

![[attachments/Untitled 28 11.png|Untitled 28 11.png]]

- It’s really easy to enable it in a piece of code → just a simple compiler (e.g. clang) flag.
- It’s not hardened → not designed to prevent memory errors, only detects them.
- **Most useful way:** once coverage guided fuzzing plateaus, run the generated corpus of files under ASan to find bugs the fuzzer missed.

## ThreadSanitizer (TSan)

![[attachments/Untitled 29 11.png|Untitled 29 11.png]]

## Frida

- It injects custom code JavaScript code into the program to modify behavior.
    - You can use this to add `printf` debugging to any closed-source program.

![[attachments/Untitled 30 11.png|Untitled 30 11.png]]

# Static Analysis

- Used to test and **prove** properties about a program.

![[attachments/Untitled 31 10.png|Untitled 31 10.png]]

## Undecidability

- The issue is that static analysis not undecidable → you can’t really determine whether a program always satisfies a property

![[attachments/Untitled 32 10.png|Untitled 32 10.png]]

- The halting problem determines whether, for a given program and an input, the program will halt or continue executing indefinitely.
    - The problem is not decidable. If it were, we could write some function `bool willHalt()`. This doesn’t work because we can write another program that uses the result of `willHalt` and just does the opposite of it (e.g. if it says it will halt, we loop forever).

## Soundness and Completeness

![[attachments/Untitled 33 10.png|Untitled 33 10.png]]

## Data flow analysis

- Very formal and rigorous reasoning about what your program can do.

![[attachments/Untitled 34 8.png|Untitled 34 8.png]]

## Taint analysis

- Analyze the path of “tainted” data.
    - If we suppose user input is “tainted”, find its path through the code.
- In the example below, suppose `ucon` is the user space (attacker).
    - We copy `ucon` into `kcon`, so we consider `kcon` to be tainted.
    - If we look at the code, there is one path where `kcon` goes directly into the `kfree` function → we’re freeing a pointer from user space, which is a security flaw.

![[attachments/Untitled 35 8.png|Untitled 35 8.png]]

## Clang static analyzer

- This is one of the most commonly used static analyzers.

![[attachments/Untitled 36 7.png|Untitled 36 7.png]]

## CodeQL(Semmle)

- Allows you to run SQL queries over code.
    - Useful when we know of a specific bad code pattern that we search for.

![[attachments/Untitled 37 7.png|Untitled 37 7.png]]

# Manual analysis

## Race condition

- You might use manual analysis to consider issues like race conditions.
    - E.g. the Google Duo bug: race condition between disabling outgoing internet traffic on client and setting up a video connection.
        - We can slow down the disabling of outgoing traffic by flooding the thread, leading to the video connection being fully set up before the outgoing traffic is disabled.
        - This allowed attacker to see a few seconds of the client video without them even picking up.

## Reverse engineering

- There are programs like Ghidra, which can decompile a binary to reverse engineer C code that you can more easily read.

![[attachments/Untitled 38 7.png|Untitled 38 7.png]]

- This can be used to exploit closed-source programs.

# Career in security

- Mission feels very rooted in the real world → your work is actively stopping attackers from exploiting your programs.
- To get started in security:
    - Start it as a hobby, and reach out to companies to try to work on it.
    - You can also do penetration testing → cyber-security expert attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system.
