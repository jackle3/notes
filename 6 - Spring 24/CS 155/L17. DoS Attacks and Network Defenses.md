# Notation

## On-Path Attacker
![[Pasted image 20240606212806.png]]
* This is the worst case scenario when it comes to network security.
	* The attacker can see and manipulate all the traffic that goes by it.
* Example: you're at a coffee shop and the attacker owns the access point.
* Example: attacker is an intelligence community that **controls a border router**.

## Off-Path Attacker
![[Pasted image 20240606212827.png]]
* The attacker can send/inject and spoof traffic, but they can't read the traffic.
* Off-path attackers want to become on-path attackers.
	* Example: **BGP hijacking** or **ARP spoofing**, in order to get traffic to flow through them.
* This is the type of attacker in a TCP reset attack -> attacker can't see traffic, but tries to inject spoofed traffic.

# No Security Guidelines
* There are no strict security guidelines for the software that we've talked so far (e.g. `Ethernet, IP, UDP, TCP, HTTP`)

* **Confidentiality:** Ethernet, IP, UDP, and TCP do not provide any confidentiality.
	* All traffic is in cleartext. There is no encryption.
	* An *on-path* attacker can do anything.
	* ARP and BGP attacks allow an *off-path* attacker to become *on-path* and act as the MITM in connections.

* **Integrity:** No guarantees that attacker hasn’t modified traffic.
	* Ethernet, IP and UDP have **no protection against spoofed packets**.
	* TCP provides weak guarantee of source authentication against off-path attackers (i.e. three-way handshake, need to match IPs and ports)

* **Availability:** No guarantees that the network or destination will be available.
	* Attackers can attempt to inject packets or launch **"denial of service"** attacks against services.

* The checksum is not enough, because there are no cryptographic guarantees in the checksum.
	* Attackers can modify content and recalculate the checksum.

## Assume network is malicious
* Always assume that the network is out to get you.

* **Solution:** Always use TLS if you want any *protection against large-scale eavesdropping* or *guarantee that data hasn’t been modified* or corrupted by an on-path (or off-path since less strong) attacker.
	* TLS and SSH are the de-facto protocol for protecting network traffic.
	* TLS 1.3 is modern, performant, and secure.

* **Note!** HTTPS and TLS aren’t just for sensitive material! There have been attacks where malicious Javascript or malware is injected into websites.

## Don't build protocols from scratch
* If you wanted to build a network protocol:
	![[Pasted image 20240606222550.png]]

* If you wanted to talk to APIs, using REST.
* However, REST is not that efficient.
	* You need to specify each field name in addition to field values.
* To fix, use **gRPC** or **Protobufs**
	* These specify which bytes go with what field, etc.
	* It's a lot more static/strict than REST.
	* The parsing on the message is done by the compiler -> safer than REST.

## DNSSEC
* Adds authentication and integrity to DNS responses
* Authoritative DNS servers **sign DNS responses** using cryptographic key 
* **Clients can verify** that a response is legitimate by checking signature through PKI similar to HTTPS 
* **Note:** Most people don’t use DNSSEC and never will. 
	* It does not really provide anything that TLS does not provide.
		* TLS checks the final step, so it knows the previous steps are safe.
		* DNSSEC only checks the first step. We still need TLS for safety.
	* Also, DNSSEC does not provide any confidentiality.

## RPKI
* Resource Public Key Infrastructure is a relatively new PKI to **help improve BGP security**
* Networks ask **regional registrars to sign a “Route Origin Authorization”** that indicates a specific ASN is allowed to advertise a given IP range
	![[Pasted image 20240608112458.png]]
* Networks **validate signed ROA against the PKI** before deciding to accept a new advertisement
	![[Pasted image 20240608112343.png]]
* **Note:** you still need TLS to be fully secure.
	* RPKI does not prevent someone else from taking your legit signed advertisement and just resending it to someone else.
		* The other person will think the advertisement was legit.

# Denial of Service (DOS) Attacks
* **Goal:** take large service/network/org offline by overwhelming it with network traffic such that they can’t process real requests
* **How:** find mechanism where attacker doesn’t spend a lot of effort, but requests are *difficult/expensive for victim to process*

* There are DoS opportunities at *every layer!*
	* **Link Layer:** send too much traffic for switches/routers to handle
	* **TCP/UDP:** require servers to maintain large number of *concurrent connections* or state
	* **Application Layer:** require servers to perform expensive queries or cryptographic operations

## Types of Attacks

* **DoS Bug:** design flaw that allows *one machine* to disrupt a service.
	* Generally a protocol asymmetry -> e.g., easy to send request, difficult to create response. Or requires server state.
* **DoS Flood:** send a large number of requests from a *botnet* or other machines you control.


## TCP: SYN Flooding

* In the traditional `SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK` handshake, the *server needs to store the sequence number* that the client gives and its own sequence number.
	![[Pasted image 20240608112854.png]]


* An attacker can flood this by sending a bunch of spoofed SYN packets.
	![[Pasted image 20240608112932.png]]

### Problem and Solution
* **Problem:** server commits resources (memory) before confirming identify of the client (when client responds)
* **Bad Solutions:**
	* Increase backlog queue size
	* Decrease timeout
* **Real Solution:** Avoid storing state until 3-way handshake completes

* To implement this solution, we can use **SYN cookies**
	* **Idea:** Instead of storing `SN_c` and `SN_s`, send a cookie back to the client in the `SYN/ACK`. 
		* `key`: picked at random during boot
		* `T`: 5-bit counter incremented every 64 secs.
		* `L`: `MAC_key (src_addr, src_port, dst_addr, dst_port, SN_C, T)`
		* `SN_s`: Calculate as `( T || mss || L )`
	* Honest client sends ACK (`AN=SN_s` and `SN=SN_C+1`) 
	* Server allocates space for socket only if valid `SN_s`

## UDP: Amplification Attacks
* Services that **respond to a single (small) UDP** packet with a **large UDP** packet can be used to *amplify DOS attacks*
	* Attacker forges packet and **sets source IP to victim’s IP** address.
	* When service responds, it **sends large packet** to the spoofed victim

* The attacker needs a large number of these services to amplify packets.
	* Otherwise, the victim could just drop the packets from the small number of hosts

### Common Amplifiers
* Common UDP amplifiers include:
	* **DNS:**
		* ANY query returns all records server has about a domain
		* **Solution:** Do not have recursive resolvers on the public Internet.
	* **NTP:**
		* `MONLIST` returns list of last 600 clients who asked for the time recently 
		* **Solution:** Do not respond to commands like MONLIST
	* Both are considered misconfigurations, but often 100Ks of misconfigured hosts on the public Internet

### Examples
* Examples of amplification attacks:
	* **2013:** DDoS attack generated 300 Gbps of traffic (DNS)
		* Used 31,000 misconfigured open DNS resolvers, each at 10 Mbps 
		* Traffic sent from 3 networks that allowed IP spoofing
	* **2014:** DDoS attack generated 400 Gbps of traaffic (NTP)
		* Used 4,500 NTP servers

## Solution: Ingress Filtering
![[Pasted image 20240608114406.png]]
* **Problem:** DDoS with spoofed source IPs.
* **Solution:** ISPs should use Ingress Filtering Policies, which states that ISPs only forwards packet with a legitimate source IP.

* **All ISPs need to do this** — requires global coordination
	* If 10% of networks don’t implement, there’s no defense
	* No incentive for an ISP to implement — doesn’t affect them

* As of 2017 (from CAIDA):
	* 33% of autonomous systems allow spoofing
	* 23% of announced IP address space allow spoofing 

* The previous 2013 example sent 300 Gbps of attack traffic from only 3 networks

## IoT: Mirai Malware
* Dyn is a DNS provider, provided for some of the largest companies including Spotify, Netflix, etc.
	* They allowed these companies to configure the DNS response for their own site.

* **Issue:** DYN got DOS'ed.
	* However, it was not an amplification attack.
	* The attacker had a **botnet of IOT devices** (hacked into thousands of IOT devices and uploaded malware)
	* They then used those devices to send requests (HTTP, DNS, TLS) to produce a massive amount of traffic.

* This attack worked because:
	* IoT security bar is very low -> many devices have public default passwords
	* There were enough devices with default passwords that they were just able to brute force it to gain control.


## Memcache: Amplification Attacks
* Memcache is a basic caching library -> simple key-value store.
	* You send a UDP packet to store the value, and another packet to retrieve it.

* Attackers can use this to launch amplification attacks.
	* Store an extremely large record.
	* Every time you retrieve it, the server sends back a huge amount of data.
	* This can overload the server -> DOS!

![[Pasted image 20240609202859.png]]


## GET Floods
* Command a bot army to:
	* Complete a real TCP connetion.
	* Complete a TLS handshake.
	* GET large image or other content.

* This will bypass flood protections, but attacker can no longer use random source IPs (need actual bots)
* **Solution:** Victim site can block or rate limit bots,

### Example: GitHub Attack

* The Chinese government was a network attacker.
	* They had the "Chinese Firewall", where all traffic into China passes through it.

* When someone make any request over HTTP:
	* Malicious JS would be injected into the HTML.
	* This JS would then perform a DOS attack on GitHub.
		* It did this by just flooding GitHub with GET requests.
* In other words, anyone who was using HTTP would become part of a botnet to DOS GitHub.

![[Pasted image 20240609203858.png]]

* **Solution:** remember to use HTTPS to make sure no one can inject code.

# Why does DOS exist?

1. **Booter Services:** there is an ecosystem where you can pay with bitcoin that would just DOS whoever you like.

# How to protect against DOS?

* The only option is to have someone host your website who has a huge amount of bandwidth.
	* If these hosts get DOS'ed, they can just absorb it without your server going offline.
* The most popular options are Cloudflare, Akamai, and Google.

## Google Project Shield

* DDoS attacks are often used to censor content.
* Google Project Shield uses Google bandwidth to shield vulnerable websites (e.g. news, blogs, human rights orgs)
![[Pasted image 20240609203356.png]]


# Network Defenses
* **Review:** Popular TCP and UDP services live on standardized ports. 
	* HTTPS servers listen on TCP/443. SSH on TCP/22.

 * There are some services you *don’t want listening on the public Internet*.
	* E.g. **Recursive DNS Resolvers** on the public internet would allow attackers to mount DDoS attacks
	* E.g. **Windows File Sharing:** historically full of vulnerabilities. What if a local machine doesn’t have a secure password on it?

## Port Scanning
* Send a SYN or application-specific UDP packet to a port to see if any service is listening on that port.
* **Vertical Scan:** Try large number of ports on a *single host*. Typically use Nmap.
* **Horizontal Scan:** Try a *single port* on a large number of hosts. Typically ZMap.

### IANA Port Numbering
* System or Well-Known Ports `[1,1023]`:
	* Common services, e.g., HTTP -> 80, SSH -> 22
* User or registered ports `[1024, 49151]`
	* Less well-known services, e.g. Minecraft servers -> 25565
* Ephemeral/Dynamic/Private Ports `[49152, 65535]` 
	* Short lived connections

## Internet Services
* **Service Search Engines:** Public services like Shodan and Censys index all of the publicly available services on the Internet.
	* They list the host IP, and the services running on each port.
	![[Pasted image 20240608120422.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240608120429.png]]

* There have been many **Attacks Against Internet Services**. For example:
	* `MOVEit` is a piece of software that allows file transfer between organizations
	* It was *vulnerable to multiple login-field SQL injection* vulnerabilities 
	* Companies were ransomwared/extorted based on the data on their public internet MOVEit Servers

## Network Firewall
* Separates local area network (LAN) from the Internet.
	* Only allow some traffic to transit.
	* Implemented as rules on a router, or sometimes a standalone device
	![[Pasted image 20240608120635.png]]

### Basic Packet Filtering
* Firewalls can perform **basic packet filtering**
* These filters only uses transport and IP layer information
	* IP Source Address, Destination Address
	* Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
	* TCP and UDP source and destination ports
* Examples: 
	* “Do not allow external hosts to connect to Windows File Sharing” 
		* `DROP ALL INBOUND PACKETS TO TCP PORT 445`

### Stateful Filtering
* Example: suppose a network has lots of servers, but they only want to allow outsiders to connect to a specific web-server.
	* The BPF command would be `DROP ALL INBOUND PACKETS IF DEST PORT != 80`
	* **Issue:** Outbound connections also have a source port! The BPF above will block their responses!

* **Solution:** stateful filtering -> firewall tracks outgoing connections and *allows associated inbound traffic* back through


### Network Address Translation
* NATs map between two different address spaces
	* Most home routers are NATs and firewalls.
![[Pasted image 20240608121249.png]]


## Local/Host Firewall
* Firewalls we’ve discussed so far have all been network firewalls.
	* Most have lived at the edge of the organization.

* Firewalls also **run on individual hosts**. Linux servers use `iptables`.
	* Typically have a combination of network and host firewalls.

* Organizations typically have a combination of network and host firewalls
	* Border **(Network) Firewall** will *block malicious traffic from the outside* and limit inbound traffic to accessing only servers intended to be accessed by the public
	* **Host Firewalls** protect *hosts from other hosts* (e.g., protect against internal compromise and malicious insiders)
		* Think of firewall rules in terms of “Defense in Depth"

## Next Generation Firewalls
* So far, firewalls operate by allowing access to a specific host or protocol
	* *But what about malicious application traffic?*
* Solution: Next Generation Firewalls **(aka Application-Layer firewalls)** 
	* Protect for attacks within L7 (application layer) traffic
* For Example:
	* Virus scanning for SMTP 
		* Need to understand protocol, MIME encoding, ZIP files, etc
	* Look for SQL injection attacks in HTTP POSTs
	* Look for a large number of authentication attempts or malformed requests


## Intrusion Detection Systems
* Software/device to monitor network traffic for attacks or policy violations 
* *Violations are reported to a central* security information and event management (SIEM) system where *analysts can later investigate*
* **Signature Detection:** maintains long list of traffic patterns (rules) associated with attacks -> detect the signature of attacks
* **Anomaly Detection:** attempts to learn normal behavior and report deviations

* Three major Open Source IDS are `Snort, Zeek, and Suricata`

* An example IDS rule in sort is:
	* In this case, it alerts if there is a packet going from `192.168.1.10` to any other destination.
	![[Pasted image 20240608121748.png]]


## Outbound Detection Systems
* Organizations will often *inspect outbound* traffic as well
	* Block access to sites with known malicious behavior
	* Prevent exfiltrating data 
	* Block services like bit torrent
* Be careful on enterprise networks!
	* Sometimes companies will even install their own root certificates on employee workstations to monitor TLS traffic



# Remote Access

## VPNs
* **Problem:** How do you provide secure communication for non-TLS protocols across the public Internet?
* **Solution:** VPNs create a fake shared network on which traffic is encrypted

* Two Broad Types:
	* Remote client (e.g., traveler with laptop) to corporate network
	* Connect two remote networks across Internet

### IPSec
* Several VPN protocols exist (PPTP, L2TP, IPsec, OpenVPN)
* Most popular is IPsec. OpenVPN is open source
	* These protocols add information to the packet to authenticate and encrypt it over the fake shared network.
	* IPSec works as follows:
		* **Transport Mode:** It takes the inner payload of the IP packet, encrypts it, and puts it back in the *same IP packet.*
			* Outsiders can see the exact destination.
		* **Tunnel Mode:** This is how VPNs mostly work. It takes the whole IP packet, encrypts it, and puts it in *another new IP packet.*
			* The destination IP of the packet is the VPN, who decrypts the packet and forwards it.
			* Outsiders can only see that you're talking to the VPN.
![[Pasted image 20240608122110.png]]

### Wireguard
* Recently introduced VPN that has gained significant following in the past 5 years over options like OpenVPN:
	* Simpler protocol and **much more performant** than OpenVPN. 
	* Relatively few configuration options reduces opportunity for error
	* Utilizes modern cryptographic primitives like Noise protocol framework, Curve25519, ChaCha20, Poly1305,

### Cisco AnyConnect
* Stanford and many other organizations use Cisco AnyConnect
* Encapsulates traffic in TLS!
	* Initial handshake uses normal TCP-based TLS
	* Then it uses DTLS (UDP-based TLS) to transport data

## Issue: Gooey Middle
* VPNs support the idea of having a secure internal network and **untrusted public Internet.** 
* Unfortunately, attacker has a ton of access once the network perimeter is breached.
	* *Internal networks aren’t that secure*. Computers are compromised all the time and attackers have free rein.

### Zero Trust Security (Beyond Corp)
* Google: assume internal network is also out to get you.
	* Remove privileged intranet and put all corporate applications on the Internet.
* Access depends solely on device and user credentials, regardless of a user’s network location
* In other words, focus on protecting applications, not the network
