# Recap

## L2: Ethernet (link layer)

- Provides connectivity between hosts on a single _Local Area Network_
- Data is split into ~1500 byte **Frames**, which are addressed to a device’s physical (MAC) address — assigned by manufacturer
- **Switches** forward frames based on learning where different MACs are located. No guarantees not sent to other hosts!
- No security (confidentiality, authentication, or integrity)

  

### ARP

- Lets hosts to find each others’ MAC addresses on a local network.
    - E.g. when you need to send packets to the upstream router to reach Internet hosts
- Client: Broadcast (to all MACs): Which MAC address has IP 192.168.1.1?
- Response: I have this IP address (sent from correct MAC)
- No built-in security.
    - Attacker can impersonate a host by faking its identity and responding to ARP requests or sending gratuitous/fake ARP announcements

  

## L3: Internet Protocol (network layer)

- Provides routing between hosts on the Internet. Unreliable. Best Effort.
    - Packets can be dropped, corrupted, repeated, reordered
- Routers simply route IP packets based on their destination address.
    - Must be simple in order to be fast — insane number packets FWD'ed
    - Each router gets the packet one hop closer to the destination.
- No inherent security. Packets have a checksum, but it’s noncryptographic. Attackers can change any packet.  
    Source address is set by sender—can be faked by an attacker  
    

  

## BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

- Internet Service Providers (ISPs) announce their presence on the Internet via BGP.
    - Each router maintains list of routes to get to different **announced prefixes**
- No authentication—possible to announce someone else’s network (hijacking)
    - Commonly occurs (often due to operator error but also due to attacks)

  

# TCP Attacks

  

## Connection Spoofing

- Can we impersonate another host when **initiating** a connection?

- Suppose the legit client is on `1.2.3.4` and the server is on `8.8.8.8`.
    
    - The attacker wants to impersonate the legit client.
    - They send a SYN saying that they are `1.2.3.4.`
    
    ![Untitled 91.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2091.png)


- The server will reply to the source IP. They send the SYN + ACK to the legit client.
    
    ![Untitled 1 58.png](../../attachments/Untitled%201%2058.png)


- To impersonate the connection, the attacker will want to send an ACK to the SYN + ACK.
    
    - However, they do not know what the server chose for its ISN.
        - Because they did not receive the SYN + ACK packet.
    - If they reply with the wrong **seqno** inside the ACK, the server will end the connection.
    
    ![Untitled 2 58.png](../../attachments/Untitled%202%2058.png)
    

  

- Furthermore, the legit client did not actually send the SYN.
    
    - When they receive the SYN + ACK, they will reply with a RST packet to reset the connection.
    
    ![Untitled 3 58.png](../../attachments/Untitled%203%2058.png)
    

  

- Attacker has a 1 in $2^{32}$﻿ chance to guess the right ISN if it was chosen uniformly at random.

  

## Reset Attack

- Can we reset an **existing** TCP connection?

  

- In a legit reset, the legit client sends the RST flag.
    
    - This packet has to contain:
        - The src IP → client IP (known)
        - The dst IP → destination IP (known)
        - The src port → random source port (**unknown**)
        - The dst port → standardized port, like port 80 (known)
    - The legit client knows all of these.
    - The attacker does not know the src port.
    
    ![Untitled 4 57.png](../../attachments/Untitled%204%2057.png)
    

  

- For the attacker to send a fake RST packet, it needs to know all four fields (IPs and ports)
    
    - Issue: source port number usually chosen random by OS
    - Attack: the attacker can brute force it by sending $2^{16}$﻿ packets, trying every source port.
    
    ![Untitled 5 57.png](../../attachments/Untitled%205%2057.png)
    

  

- Realistically, $2^{16}$﻿ packets is not that many packets to send.
    - Solution: we require the RST packet to have a sequence number within the current receive window of the server.
    - On most modern OSes, windows are 32 to 64 kilobytes.
- Attacker has a $1$﻿ in $2^{16+32}/W$﻿ (where W is window size) chance to guess right
    - The 16 comes from the different port numbers.
    - The 32 comes from the range of sequence numbers.
    - The division by W comes from the fact that we only need to be inside the window.

# DNS (Domain Name System)

- In the application-layer, protocols (and people) usually refer to Internet host by host name (e.g., [google.com](http://google.com/))
- DNS is a delegatable, hierarchical name space, that maps a hostname to an IP address.
    
    - The domain and subdomain is also called the second-level and third-level domain.
    
    ![Untitled 6 56.png](../../attachments/Untitled%206%2056.png)
    

  

- We can think of DNS as a tree with a `root`.
    
    - The root goes to the top-level domains.
    - Each TLD goes to a second-level domain, etc.
    - To buy a domain, we can buy them from each TLD, etc.
    
    ![Untitled 7 56.png](../../attachments/Untitled%207%2056.png)
    

  

- DNS runs over **UDP** → it sends one request packet, and receives one response packet.
    
    - If it did TCP there would be a lot of packets sent just to receive a single IP address.
        - It needs to send `(1) SYN`, then receive `(2) SYN/ACK`, then send `(3) ACK`, then send `(4) query`, then receive `(5) answer`, then send `(6) FIN`, then receive `(7) FIN/ACK`, then send `(8) ACK`
    
      
    
    - With DNS over UDP, if a packet is dropped, it just resends the request until it gets a response.

  

## DNS Record

- A DNS server has a set of records it authoritatively knows about.

![Untitled 8 55.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2055.png)

  

## DNS Root Name Servers

- In total, there are 13 main DNS root servers, each of which is named with the letters 'A' to 'M'.
    
    - The IP addresses of these root servers are hardcoded/preloaded into every DNS client.
    
    ![Untitled 9 54.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2054.png)
    

  

## DNS Recursion Example

- Suppose we send a DNS query for [google.com](http://google.com).
    - Specifically, we ask for the A-record of [google.com](http://google.com) → A stands for IP address

  

- We will go to each of the root servers, and ask if they know the IP for [google.com](http://google.com)
    
    - Because they are the root, they will reply “No, but I know who manages `.com`"
        - They will reply with a **name-server record →** { NS for `.com` → [ns1.dns.com](http://ns1.dns.com) }
        - They will also reply with an **A-record →** { A for [ns1.dns.com](http://ns1.dns.com) → `2.3.4.5` }
    
    ![Untitled 10 52.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2010%2052.png)
    

  

- We will then go to **authoritative server** for `.com` at `2.3.4.5` and ask again.
    
    - They might reply “No, but I know the name server for [google.com](http://google.com)“
        - They will reply with an NS record → { NS for [google.com](http://google.com) → [ns1.google.com](http://ns1.google.com) }
        - They will reply with an A record → {A for [ns1.google.com](http://ns1.google.com) → `3.4.5.6` }
    
    ![Untitled 11 52.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%2052.png)
    

  

- Now that we know who is responsible for [google.com](http://google.com), we can go ask them.
    
    - They might reply “Yes, I know the IP for [google.com](http://google.com)“
        - They will reply with an A record → {A for [google.com](http://google.com) → `8.8.8.8` }
    
    ![Untitled 12 52.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%2052.png)
    

  

- At this point, now that we know the IP for [google.com](http://google.com), we can create our IP packet.

  

### Glue Record

- Glue Record is the A-record that was included whenever they replied with an NS-record.
    - Useful because the NS-record only gives the hostname of the name server.
    - If the glue record was not there, we have to lookup the IP of the name server manually.

## Actual DNS Recursion

- When we send a message, we send a Query ID and a list of questions.
    - These questions might include asking for the A-record of [google.com](http://google.com)
- When they reply, they send an Answers list, Authorities list, and Additionals list.
    - Answers → the actual answer (i.e. the IP of [google.com](http://google.com))
    - Authorities → the authoritative name servers that knows how to find [google.com](http://google.com)
    - Additionals → the glue record for the authoritative server.

### DNS Request

- Below is an example DNS request. Notice the question field.

![Untitled 16 44.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2016%2044.png)

  

### DNS Response

- Below is an example DNS response → notice that it only gives the authorities and additionals.

![Untitled 17 41.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2017%2041.png)

  

- Below is an **authoritative response** → notice that it gives the answer.

![Untitled 18 39.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2018%2039.png)

  

## DNS Security

- Users/hosts trust the host-address mapping provided by DNS
    - Used as basis for many security policies:
        - Browser same origin policy, URL address bar
- Interception of requests or compromise of DNS servers can result in incorrect or malicious responses

  

## Caching

- DNS responses are cached
    - Quick response for repeated translations
    - NS records for domains also cached
- DNS negative queries are cached
    - Save time for nonexistent sites, e.g. misspelling
- Cached data periodically times out
    - Lifetime (TTL) of data controlled by owner of data
    - TTL passed with every record

  

  

# DNS Attacks

  

## Cache Poisoning

- DNS query results include Additional Records section
    - It’s supposed to provide records for anticipated next resolution step
- Early servers accepted and cached all additional records provided in query response
    - Attack: provide fake IP addresses in the Additional Records.

  

- For example, in the example above, a malicious name server can say that the IP of [bankofamerica.com](http://bankofamerica.com) is `7.7.7.7` → not true, but because of DNS, it will remember it.
    
    ![Untitled 19 36.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2019%2036.png)
    

  

- Below is a step-by-step of the attack:
    
    ![Untitled 20 35.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2020%2035.png)
    

  

### Bailiwick Checking

- To prevent cache poisoning, only accept additional records that are for a domain in the original question.

![Untitled 21 32.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2021%2032.png)

  

## DNS Spoofing

- Scenario: DNS client issues query to a legit DNS server.
    - The request packet includes the src IP, dst IP, src port, and dst port.

  

- An attacker would like to inject a fake reply, but it does not see query or real response.
    1. It spoofs the IP and port of the legit DNS server.
        1. In other words, it knows dst IP, dst port, and src IP of query.
    2. it Injects a fake response.

  

- The client authenticates DNS responses by ensuring that:
    - UDP port numbers must match
        - dst port usually port 53 by convention, so only src port is unknown.
    - 16-bit query ID must match

  

- To fake a reply, it needs to know the src port and Query ID of original query.
    - Before, the source port was given incrementally, so it was pretty quick to guess it.
    - So the only thing would be the 16-bit query ID.
    - The attacker wins if it can guess the $1$﻿ of the $2^{16}$﻿ query IDs in under the RTT of the legit DNS server.
        - This is pretty unlikely, especially because once the legit server responds, the client won’t ask/accept responses again.

  

### Kaminsky Attack

- Idea: trick the client into sending DNS queries repeatedly, so we get more tries.
- Suppose the victim visits [attacker.com](http://attacker.com), which has JS that sends a GET request to [bank.com](http://bank.com)
    
    ![Untitled 22 28.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2022%2028.png)
    

  

- This leads to a DNS lookup for [bank.com](http://bank.com)
    - Somewhere, there will be a DNS cache to cache the IP address of the hostname.
        
        - This cache might contain:
            - A-record: [bank.com](http://bank.com) goes to some IP
            - A-record: [ns1.bank.com](http://ns1.bank.com) goes to some other IP
            - NS-record: NS of [bank.com](http://bank.com) is at [ns1.bank.com](http://ns1.bank.com)
        
        ![Untitled 23 26.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2023%2026.png)
        

  

- Attack: every time you lookup a subdomain, it will initiate a DNS request.
    - Even if the domain doesn’t exist, it won’t known until it makes the request.
    - For each DNS query, the attacker gets another chance to inject a fake reply.
        - This gives them another try to guess the Query ID (and source port).

  

![Untitled 24 25.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2024%2025.png)

  

### Defenses

- Increase QueryID space.
- Randomize src port, additional 11 bits of entropy
    - Attack now takes several hours

  

## DNS Rebinding

- This attack occurs when there is a malicious name server.
    
    - When a server replies, it can specify the TTL → if it says `TTL = 0`, this means don’t cache this response.
    - When the server replies again, it can change the response to something else, and the client won’t know.
    
    ![Untitled 25 22.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2025%2022.png)
    

  

- Now suppose [attacker.com](http://attack.com) has some JS in it that makes a GET request to `/login`
    
    - This is allowed bc its the same origin!
    - Now, you think you are talking to [attacker.com](http://attacker.com), but you are actually sending it to your home router.
    
    ![Untitled 26 19.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2026%2019.png)
    

  

- The attacker has effectively rebound [attacker.com](http://attacker.com) to a different IP address.
    
    ![Untitled 27 17.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2027%2017.png)
    

  

### Defenses

- **Browser Mitigations:**
    - Refuse to switch IPs mid session
        - Regardless of the provided TTL, it will remember it and use that IP for the entire session.
        - However:
            - This interacts poorly with proxies, VPNs, CDNs, etc
            - Not consistently implemented in any browser
- **Server Defenses**
    - Check `Host` header for unrecognized domains
    - Authenticate users with something else beyond IP address
