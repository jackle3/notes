# Buffer overflows

- Common bug in C/C++ programs.
    - Even though this is very well known, there is a significant and increasing number of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

![[attachments/Untitled 1 43.png|Untitled 1 43.png]]

- The current recommended language for projects is Rust → safe and performant.

## Details

![[attachments/Untitled 2 43.png|Untitled 2 43.png]]

- When `exec()` is called, it will cannibalize the current process and run a different program on that process.

## Memory Structure

- The linux memory structure is as follows:
    
    - The executable lives at the very bottom of memory.
    - We then have an upwards growing heap, and a downwards growing stack.
    - This is also where shared libraries live → e.g. `libc` lives here.
        - Shared libs are mapped into the virtual memory of every process, but they all point to the same physical memory.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 3 43.png|Untitled 3 43.png]]
    
- Above this memory (at the very top, around `0x7FFF...` ) is where the OS lives.

## Stack Frame

- Every time you call a function, a new stack frame is created. This is placed underneath.
- The **stack base pointer** points to the stack pointer of the previous stack frame.
    - You can use this to walk up the stack, kinda like a linked list.

## Basic Example

- Suppose we have the following function. This can cause an issue if `str` is longer than `128`.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 5 42.png|Untitled 5 42.png]]
    
- If str is too long, we overflow the buffer and mess up the other parts of the stack frame.
    
    - Note that `strcpy` adds into `buf` from the bottom and goes up.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 6 41.png|Untitled 6 41.png]]
    
- The attacker can use this to overwrite the return address. When the function returns, it will go to where the attacker wants it to go.
    
    - The attacker can provide like a 1KB url to overwrite a large chunk of the stack and also include the program to call shell.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 7 41.png|Untitled 7 41.png]]
    
- Note that the attacker doesn’t really know the exact address of Program P since P runs in the stack. To fix this, the attacker uses the no-operation (NOP) slide.
    
    - The attacker will create a large overflow string, most of which consists of `nop`. This instruction does nothing → does not change control flow of program.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 8 41.png|Untitled 8 41.png]]
    
    - The attacker now only has to redirect the return address to somewhere in the NOP slide, which will bring it into Program P.

## Complications

- Program P should not contain the `\0` character → otherwise `strcpy` will stop.
    - Basically have to write shell/machine code without using `0`.
- Overflow should not crash the program before `func()` exits.

## Unsafe libc functions

- Most of the basic `libc` functions are unsafe. Though there are some safe alternatives, such as the one in Windows.

## Other opportunities for overflow

![[attachments/Untitled 10 39.png|Untitled 10 39.png]]

# Heap exploits

- In C++, an object on the heap has data and a bunch of virtual functions/methods associated with that object.
    
    - The first entry in the object’s data is a pointer to a `vtable`, which contains the addresses of the methods supported by the object.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 11 39.png|Untitled 11 39.png]]
    
- Suppose we had a heap-allocated string that is right next to the `vtable`.
    
    - If the string overflows, it can override the `vtable` , so when that method is called, it will call the attacker’s code.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 12 39.png|Untitled 12 39.png]]
    

## Example and issue: exploiting browser heap

![[attachments/Untitled 13 37.png|Untitled 13 37.png]]

- The javascript send by the attacker can look like below:
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 14 35.png|Untitled 14 35.png]]
    
    - The `cause-overflow` function will copy the string to overflow `buf[]`, then trigger the method on the `vtable` to call the `shellcode`.
- This is hard because we don’t know for sure where the shell code is located on the heap.
    
    - Recall that the `vtable` expects pointers to functions.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 15 33.png|Untitled 15 33.png]]
    
    - How can the attacker figure out what address to put in the overflow string, to point to the `shellcode`?

## Heap spraying

- One solution is to spray the heap (e.g. add many copies) of the NOP slide and shell code.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 16 33.png|Untitled 16 33.png]]
    
    - We can just make the `vtable` point anywhere. It is likely that it will at least hit one of the NOP slides and slide into the shell code.
- In the code below, we make a huge 100KB `NOP slide`.
    
    - Then, we allocate an array of 1000 pointers. We make each of these pointers point to our exploited code to fill up heap space.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 17 30.png|Untitled 17 30.png]]
    
- This is a **zero-click exploit**. Anyone visiting the webpage will get this javascript, and they will then be infected.

# Overflow Mitigations

- The most ideal fix would be a better browser architecture, but this is intractable due to cost.

## Guard Pages

- Uses the fact that we are using virtual memory (virtual addr mapped to physical addr)
- Every object is on a single page. The following page is marked as non-writable.
    - The `string buf[]` is on one page, and the `vtable` is on another.
    - This makes it impossible to overflow because you hit the guard page.

![[attachments/Untitled 18 28.png|Untitled 18 28.png]]

- If we overflow into the guard page, the program will crash.
    - We would rather have a crash than have it be exploited.
- Every page might still have multiple objects → you can still overflow within a page.
    - **eFence**: makes sure that every object is on a separate page → lots of wasted memory

# Finding overflows by fuzzing

- AFL is a fuzzer → bombards the program with malformed inputs to try to crash it.
    - Typically puts special symbol at the end of the request to easily find overflow location.

![[attachments/Untitled 19 25.png|Untitled 19 25.png]]

# Integer Overflow

- This occurs when an `int` or similar exceeds its max value.

![[attachments/Untitled 20 25.png|Untitled 20 25.png]]

- With an `unsigned`, it will overflow back to zero. With `signed`, it can overflow to negative.

## Example

- In the example below, it takes two buffers, and tries to concatenate the two buffers.

![[attachments/Untitled 21 22.png|Untitled 21 22.png]]

- It has a check to make sure that the two buffers can fit inside `temp`
    - However, `len1 + len2` can overflow the `unsigned int`
        
        ![[attachments/Untitled 22 18.png|Untitled 22 18.png]]
        
        - It will satisfy the length check even though it will overflow when it concatenates
- Below is the correct way to write this code to ensure it does not integer overflow.

![[attachments/Untitled 23 17.png|Untitled 23 17.png]]

- We can also trigger vulnerabilities using subtracting of `unsigned`
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 24 16.png|Untitled 24 16.png]]
    
    - In this example, if `nlen = 8192`, the subtraction will lead to a giant number, causing it to pass the length check even though `nlen + vlen >= 8190`.

# Format string vulnerabilities

- In the example below, `func` writes the user provided string directly to stderr.
    - Normally, `fprintf` is used as `fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)`
    - Here, they use the user provided input as the `format` argument.
- If the user passes in `%s%s%s%s%s%s%s`, it will expect 7 strings on the stack to be printed out.
    - Interprets values in the stack frame as strings to be printed out.

![[attachments/Untitled 25 13.png|Untitled 25 13.png]]

- The correct form is to explicitly specify the format string.

![[attachments/Untitled 26 12.png|Untitled 26 12.png]]

- Any function using a format string can be exploited in this way.
    - Printing: `printf, fprintf, sprintf, vprintf, vfprintf, vsprintf`
    - Loggin: `syslog, err, warn`

## Exploit

- First, the attacker can use the format string to walk up the stack (`%08x` walks up 8 bytes of the stack at a time) and then printing something they want `%s` .

![[attachments/Untitled 27 11.png|Untitled 27 11.png]]

- The attacker can also use the format string to write directly to memory to exploit.

![[attachments/Untitled 28 10.png|Untitled 28 10.png]]

# Double free

- Occurs when you call free on an object, then you call free again
    - Doing this can cause pointers on the heap to point to unintended locations → exploit

![[attachments/Untitled 29 10.png|Untitled 29 10.png]]

# Use after free

- Occurs when we use memory after it has already been freed.
- Below is a webpage that a malicious web server would serve to IE11 → zero click infection
    
    - In IE11, the `form` is one object on the heap, the first `textarea` is another, and the `input` is another object.
    
    1. The attacker first creates a form with a text field (”c1”) and an input field (”c2”)
    2. It creates a function `changer` that gets the `form` and clears out its `innerHTML`.
        - It calls `collectGarbage` as well → this frees the objects from the heap.
            - This effectively deletes the two objects inside the form.
    3. Then, it adds that as a handler to “c1”. Every time some property changes on “c1”, the function is called → if something happens in “c1”, the form is deleted.
    4. Then, it calls the reset function. This restores all the form fields to default values.

![[attachments/Untitled 30 10.png|Untitled 30 10.png]]

## Exploit

- When `c1.DoReset()` is called, a property changes, so the `changer` function is called. This deletes the fields within the form → “c1” and “c2” have been freed.
    - When you call `c2.DoReset()` , you call a method on an object that was just freed.

![[attachments/Untitled 31 9.png|Untitled 31 9.png]]

- The attacker can exploit this. Suppose they allocate a string to be at the exact same location as the `vtable`.

![[attachments/Untitled 32 9.png|Untitled 32 9.png]]

- Calling `doReset()` on “c2” is the use after free.
    1. Since it has already been freed, the attacker was able to insert their own code into the `vtable`.
    2. When the method is called, it calls the attacker’s shell code.
- To insert their code, the attacker can modify the `changer` function to allocate it.\
    - The allocation is a bit complicated → you have to spray the heap.

![[attachments/Untitled 33 9.png|Untitled 33 9.png]]

- This kind of exploit can be found using a fuzzer.
