- “Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications using codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.”
	- Protects against eavesdropping and tampering.
	- We want authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality
		- Authenticity means you can confirm someones identity
		- Integrity means your messages can’t be tampered.
		- Confidentiality means it should not be eavesdropped upon.

- MACS provide integrity.
- Ciphers and encryption provide confidentiality.
- AE and AEAD provide integrity and confidentiality.
- Signatures and certificates provide authenticity.

# Symmetric Cipher

![Untitled 89.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2089.png)

- We don’t want to have security by obscurity → make the algorithms for E and D public.
- The steps of the symmetric cipher are:
	1. Take a key k
	2. Take a message m
	3. Take a nonce n
	4. encrypt(m, n, k) outputs ciphertext c
	5. decypt(c, n, k) outputs m

## Nonces

- If you use the same key more than once, you need a nonce.
	- This makes it so that same messages have different ciphertexts.

## One-use: One time Pad

- Represent a message and a random key in binary.
- To encrypt, XOR the message and the key to produce ciphertext c
- To decrypt, XOR ciphertext with the key to retrieve the message

![Untitled 2 56.png](../../attachments/Untitled%202%2056.png)

- We don’t use this method more widely because **the one time pad requires the key to be the same length as the message.**

## One-use: Stream Ciphers

- Stretches a smaller length key into the size of the message → fixes issues with OTP
	- Use pseudo-random generator with the key to produce the key for the message.

## Multi-use: Block Ciphers

- Encrypts n bits, then outputs n bits as cipher text.
	- The block size n and the key size k are chosen independently.

![Untitled 4 55.png](../../attachments/Untitled%204%2055.png)

- The steps of the block cipher are:
	1. Take a key k
	2. Expand k with a PRG to get r keys k{1}, … , k{r}
	3. Keys k{1},…, k{r-1} are used to run the same round function r-1 times.
		1. The round function tries to behave like a random function
	4. Key k{r} is used to run a slightly different round function one last time.

- There are two ways to run a block cipher:

	- Electronic code book (ECB) mode → don’t use this
		- ECB mode does not use a nonce, so same blocks have same ciphertext.
	- Counter (CTR) mode → yes, use this.

# Tamper Protection

## MACs

- The steps of Message authentication codes (MACs) are:
	1. Take a message m and key k.
	2. Generate tags with S(k, m), where S stands for sign.
	3. Verify the message m and tag t via V(k, m, tag), where V stands for verify.
	4. Notice how the key k is shared by all parties.
- Hash MAC (HMAC) is a widely used MAC today.

## AE and AEAD
- AE: Authenticated encryption (MAC + Encryption).
- Remember to encrypt then MAC, not MAC then encrypt.
	- Guarantees that we never decrypt data that has been tampered with.

- AEAD: Encrypt the payload data and **authenticate the metadata** (associated data) and encrypted payload data.
	- AES-GCM is one such AEAD algorithm: **Encrypt payload with CTR mode** and then **MAC the metadata and ciphertext**.

## CRIME Attack

- We usually want to compress data then encrypt it in order to shorten the ciphertext length.
- However, the ciphertext length reveals information:
	1. Trick the victim to visit an attacker controlled website.
	2. The website issues many requests to [bank.com](http://bank.com/).
		1. The attacker can’t read the user’s cookie to bank.com, but the cookie will be attached in the request.
	3. Based on what requests the attacker makes, some requests will be more heavily
		compressed.
		1. The attacker can measure the lengths of these requests.
	4. The attacker uses this information to figure out the victim’s cookies.
- Solution: Change the cookie after each request.

# Asymmetric Encryption

## Digital Signatures

- Signature binds documents to an author.
	- In asymmetric encryption, we make the **signature depend on the data’s contents.**
- There are three components to a signature:
	- The secret key is used to sign the document
	- The public key is used to verify the document.
	- The message/document itself.
- **sign(sk, message)** gives the signature
- **verify(pk, message, signature)** verifies the signature

## Digital Signatures vs. MACs

- MAC: There is a shared key. Thus, both parties can sign and verify.
- Digital signature: Only the entity with the secret key can sign. Anyone with the public key can verify.
	- This is why its useful for verifying someones identity.

## Certificates

- A webserver reaches out to a CA to gain a certificate. The CA, after seeing proof, gives the webserver a certificate containing its public key.
- A CA signs a document, the certificate, which announces a website’s public key.
- Each OS and browser have a set of CAs that it trusts; based on this built in set, certificates can be verified.
	- It will verify the certificate chain → trusted CAs can give certificates to other CAs, etc.
- The CA signature is created using digital signatures, like an RSA-based signature.
	- **Common name** and **subject alternate names**: important fields containing the domains that the certificate can be verified on.

# TLS

## Diffie Hellman

- The two users compute a shared pre-master secret that’s hard to compute.
	- Usually, this will be computed as $g^x\mod p$﻿

![Untitled 6 54.png](../../attachments/Untitled%206%2054.png)

## Session Setup

- The KeyShare in ClientHello is when the client sends `a`. Then, the server can calculate the Diffie-Hellman key since it knows its `b`.
- It then sends `b` back to the client in the ServerHello.
- The nonces changes for every TLS session.
	- Prevents replay attacks → nonce changes the key, so people who stole a packet won’t be able to replay it.
- The shared session key is `HKDF(DHkey, nonce_c, nonce_s)` → slightly more complicated than just the DHkey.

![Untitled 7 54.png](../../attachments/Untitled%207%2054.png)

## Optimizations

2. 0-RTT: Use a pre-shared key, like a previous session key.
	1. In ClientHello, pass in some data that you want the server to start processing earlier.
	2. The 0-RTT data should result in no side effects → e.g. load home page.
3. QUIC handshake: Integrates TCP and TLS handshake together. Encrypts by default.

## Other TLS Notes

- Server name extension (SNI): says which server you are trying to contact.
	- We use an encrypted client hello to protect privacy.
- Negative versus positive security indicators: Use negative indicators.

## SSL Strip Attack

4. You try to visit [bank.com](http://bank.com/) over HTTP.
5. An attacker sits between your computer and a web server you contacted.
6. They make an **TLS handshake with the web server** and an **HTTP connection with you**.
7. All of your information to the web server can be seen by the attacker.

- Defense 1: Strict Transport Security (HSTS). After the first visit via HTTPS:
	1. Browser refuses to connect over HTTP or if site presents an invalid cert.
	2. Requires that entire site be served over valid HTTPS.

- Defense 2: HSTS preload – browser knows before first load that the site uses TLS.
	1. Browser has a preloaded list of sites that require HTTPS.

## Preventing Malicious Certificates

- Malicious certificates happen when a bad CA issues certificates that they do not have the authority to issue.

	- The attacker proxies data between the user and bank. They can see and modify all traffic.

	![Untitled 8 54.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%2054.png)

- To solve this:
	1. Public-key pinning: Hardcode a list of CAs for a certain site.
	2. Certificate Transparency (CT): Log all issued certificates. Companies can audit this log to find erroneous issuance.

# Processor Security

## Cryptography and Hardware

2. AES-NI
	1. The processor implements one round of AES. All instructions run in constant time!
		1. These instructions make AES super fast, making crytography more accessible.
	2. `aesenc` is one such instruction.
3. RDRAND
	1. Processor provides a random number generator.

## Enclaves

5. Key idea: We keep the trusted computing base to the processor.
	1. We only trust the processor. If we ask a processor something, it won’t lie to us.
6. Processor encrypts all writes to RAM.
	1. We don’t trust memory (or anything else)
7. Enclave pages can only be accessed when you call `EENTER`
	1. The processor controls how we access enclave pages with these instructions.

## Attestation

9. The enclave generates a public key (`pk`) and secret key (`sk`).
10. The processor computes a hash of the code in the enclave, the report (`r`).
11. `pk` and `r` are sent to Intel’s app enclave.
12. The app enclave sends `pk` and `r` to the quoting server.
13. The quoting server contains a **secret key issued by Intel**. It signs `pk` and `r`.
	1. A malicious enclave cannot modify the report `r` after the quoting server signs it, since the signature will change.
14. Remote server can **verify what code runs in the enclave** with `r`.
	1. It can encrypt data it sends to the enclave with `pk`.
	2. Only the enclave can decrypt it, using the `sk`.

## Speculative Execution

- While the processor is waiting for the uncached value to load from memory, if the branch predictor thinks the if-statement should run, it will speculatively execute `a = compute(b)`.

![Untitled 9 53.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%2053.png)

- Instructions have side effects!

## Spectre Attack (speculative execution)

- The issue with seculative execution is that instructions have side effects!
	- Specifically, speculative execution can affect the cache of the processor.

```JavaScript
array_size = 100;
if (x < array_size)
	y = array2[array1[x]*4096];
```

- What can the attacker do and not do?
	- CAN choose x (program input).
	- CAN prepare cache lines to contain random junk.
	- CAN measure how much time instructions in your code take.
	- CAN read your source code.
	- CAN run another process on the same machine
	- CANNOT read your memory space.

- Attack ideas
	- Instructions on cached memory addresses run much faster than cache misses.
	- Branches ran speculatively are undone when the condition is realized to be false, but their cache side effects stay.

- Example: let’s leak the byte stored at `array1[x]` for `x = 1000`
	1. The attacker trains the branch predictor to expect `if()` to evaluate to true.
	2. Evict `array_size` and `array2` from cache.
	3. Say we want to read memory at `array1_base + 1000` (maybe it’s the first byte of a password).
	4. The `if` speculatively executes, loading `array2[array1[x] * 4096]` into the cache.
	5. Suppose `array1[x]` had the value 9.
		1. This means `array2[9 * 4096]` will be in the cache after speculative execution.
	6. When the attacker reads `array2[9 * 4096]`, the read will complete really quickly compared to other values.
