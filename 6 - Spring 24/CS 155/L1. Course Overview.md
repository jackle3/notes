# Computer security problem

![Untitled 80.png](attachments/Untitled%2080.png)

- Malware is like keystroke loggers, etc

![Untitled 1 47.png](attachments/Untitled%201%2047.png)

- There are many different type of attacks, including exploits and social engineering

# Overview

![Untitled 2 47.png](attachments/Untitled%202%2047.png)

# What motivates attackers?

- The answer is economics → money to be made from attacking systems

## Credentials

- Attackers can steal user credentials to get access to user accounts.
    
    - **Adversary-in-the-Browser (AITB)** → injects code into login page so that when the user logs in, it also sends that information out to the attacker.
        - Encryption can’t protect your data here. They are in the browser itself, so they can see everything user sees.

- **Zbot** - a common financial malware program.
    - Records banking passwords via keylogger
    - It spreads via spam emails and hacked websites
    - It maintains access to PC, so attackers can use it for further attacks or installs

## Ransomware

- Attackers can also break in for **ransomware**
    - Usually, they break into a database and encrypt all of the data. They then ask for money in exchange for the decryption key.

- Exploits spread via vulnerabilities via worms

## Bitcoin Mining

- Attacks can also just break into computers to use it to mine bitcoin.

# Server-side attacks

- If webservers have vulnerabilities, such as running old versions of Apache web server, they can be exploited.

![Untitled 8 45.png](attachments/Untitled%208%2045.png)

## Steps

- Typically a sequence of steps taken by attackers to breach a server.
    - The attack first explores the server.
    - It then does an initial breach.
    - Then, it does internal reconnaisance, usually to find the database.

- There is a **kill chain** of security tools → tools designed to stop each step. If just one step fails, then we stopped the attack.

## Supply Chain Attack

# Case Study: SolarWinds Orion

- SolarWinds is a security company, and Orion was their product. This product was used by a very large amount of customers.
- Attackers corrupts the software update process, infecting users with the vulnerable update.
    - More specifically, they infected the build system of SolarWinds.
    - Everytime SolarWinds rebuilds the system to issue a software update, the malware injects the exploit into the executable.

## Malware Injection

- The infection was simply an executable being ran on the build system.
- It replaces a file with malware during build, then restores the original file to hide traces.

# Case Study: PyPI

![Untitled 13 41.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%2041.png)

- One consideration with pip is **dependencies**. If some system depends on an exploited package, then that system is also exploited.
    
    ![Untitled 14 39.png](attachments/Untitled%2014%2039.png)
    
- Another consideration is **typo-squatting**.

# Case Study: LLM

![Untitled 16 36.png](attachments/Untitled%2016%2036.png)

- In the example above, the incoming email can come from an adversary. If they give adversarial inputs, they can extract training data.

# Marketplace for Exploits

![Untitled 18 31.png](attachments/Untitled%2018%2031.png)

- It’s mostly government organizations that buy these exploits.

# Ken Thompson’s Trojan

- We can’t trust code because the source code may have been modified.
    
    ![Untitled 19 28.png](attachments/Untitled%2019%2028.png)
    
- We also can’t trust the compiler since the compiler itself has been modified.
    
    ![Untitled 20 28.png](attachments/Untitled%2020%2028.png)
    
- To fix this, we can inspect the compiler then recompile the compiler. However, the compiler might have a backdoor.

![Untitled 22 21.png](attachments/Untitled%2022%2021.png)

- Attackers create a modified compiler binary, then restore the source code to hide traces.

# Summary

- In order to build trust, we need to have a trusted computing base
