# Recap: attacks

![[attachments/Untitled 79.png|Untitled 79.png]]

# Issue with C/C++

- The primary issue is a design flaw → they mix data and control signals on the same channel
    - This allows anyone to inject control signals given access to the data.
- This is what happens with a buffer overflow attack.
    - Local variables and the control data (e.g. return address) are both on the stack.

# Preventing hijacking attacks

1. Fix bugs → prevent attacks from happening.
    1. There exists Audit software that does this.
        1. Automated tools: Coverity, Infer, …
    2. Rewrite software in a type safe language (Java, Go, Rust)
        1. This is difficult for existing (legacy) code
2. Platform defenses: prevent attack code execution.
3. Harden executable to detect control hijacking.
    1. Halt process and report when exploit detected.
    2. E.g. StackGuard, ShadowStack, Memory tagging (ASan, MTE), …

> [!important]  
> The goal is to transform a breach/exploit to simply a denial of service/crash  

# Platform defenses

- The first defense is known as DEP → data execute prevention.
    - It essentially makes it so that the memory in that page can’t be executed.
    - In other words, if the RIP ever jumps to that page, the program will crash → it’s trying to execute it.
	    - Set the NX bit on the page.
- However, some apps need to execute the heap (e.g. just-in-time or JITs)
    - For example, the browser…
        1. Loads JavaScript from the server
        2. Then uses a JIT compiler to compile that code into machine code
        3. Puts that machine code into the heap
        4. Then jumps into the heap to execute that code

# Return oriented programming (ROP)

- With DEP, the attacker can’t put their shell code into the buffer/stack because they can’t execute it.
- However, the attacker can exploit it by making it so that it calls existing built-in functions.
    - The string “bin/sh” and the exec() function are both in the `libc` code.
    - We can make it so that the arguments and the return address point to the code inside the `libc` library.

## Details

- We first need to map `stdin` and `stdout` into the socket `s`.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 4 45.png|Untitled 4 45.png]]
    
- The attacker will do this by finding gadgets in the victim’s program memory.
    
    - One gadget might call `execve` , and another gadget might call `dup2` and then call `ret`
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 5 45.png|Untitled 5 45.png]]
    
    - The attacker can make the return address point into the `dup2` gadget. It will call it, then call its own `ret`, which brings it back to the exploited stack.
- In summary, the overflow string will be a string of addresses that organizes the gadgets one after another.

## More detail

- In more detail, each function call above will be a sequence of several gadgets of assembly.
- For instance, to call `execve`, there are a few gadgets we must have.
    - First, we have to set `rdi` to be the string “/bin/sh”. This is the first argument.
    - You need to set `rsi` and `rdx` to be zero for the next arguments.
    - You need to set `rax` to be 59, which is the syscall number for `execve`
- In machine code, `5f` is the assembly instruction `pop rdi`
    - `c3` is the machine code for `ret` → we’ll be looking for gadgets that end in `ret`
- To find the first gadget, we just scan through memory to find `5fc3` for the gadget.

![[attachments/Untitled 6 44.png|Untitled 6 44.png]]

- In terms of the overflow string:
    1. you set your return address to be the address of the first gadget.
    2. you put the address of “/bin/sh” as the next element in the stack so that it will load it into `rdi` when it pops it from the stack.
        1. when you call `pop rdi`, you pop the next thing on the stack into the `rdi` register.

> [!important]  
> You arrange the gadgets in order. The return of the first gadget will cause the second gadget to run. The return of the second gadget will cause the third to run…  

- The `ret` instruction pops the next address (the next gadget) off the stack into the instruction pointer.
- When the first gadget completes execution, the `ret` at its end effectively does the following:
    - It takes the next value from the stack (which is the address of the second gadget, deliberately placed there by your exploit).
    - Moves this value into the instruction pointer, thereby setting the CPU to execute the next sequence of instructions starting at this new address.

## Prevention: Randomization (ASLR)

- They key problem is that the attacker knows exactly where the gadgets are inside memory.
    - There is no address difference between running in `gdb` and when it’s actually being run.
- To fix this, when some library or executable is loaded, the base address is randomized so that it can be shifted around better.
    - The entire executable/chunk of instructions is shifted as one piece in memory.

![[attachments/Untitled 7 44.png|Untitled 7 44.png]]

- The attacker can try to guess where the gadgets are.
    - With 24 bits of randomness, they have a probability of $1/2^{24}$﻿ of guessing correctly.

## Prevention: kBouncer

- The use of gadgets makes the execution sequence quite abnormal.
    - `ret` usually returns to an address that follows a `call`
    - However, gadgets are not using `call` before the `ret`.

![[attachments/Untitled 9 43.png|Untitled 9 43.png]]

- It’s not employed in practice because it’s easy to get around them.
    - You set up the gadgets that are necessary to set up the registers for the `syscall`.
    - Then you find 16 more gadgets that have a `call` then a `return`.

# Hardening the executable

- The difference is that here, we can recompile the executable to build a stronger and less vulnerable executable.
- This might mean changing the complier to include stronger protections on the stack.

## Run time checking: StackGuard

- Inserts a canary between the local variables and the control variables.
    - When the function starts, the function prologue injects the canary into the stack.
    - When the function returns, the function epilogue checks that the canary is undamaged.
        - If it is damaged, it crashes the program.

## Canary types

![[attachments/Untitled 11 42.png|Untitled 11 42.png]]

- The terminator canary would be something like a bunch of zeros.
    - This makes it so that you can’t use something like `strcpy` to exploit since it will stop copying once it hits the terminator.

## Implementation

![[attachments/Untitled 12 42.png|Untitled 12 42.png]]

## Enhancement: ProPolice

- In addition, another enhancement is rearranging the stack layout to ensure all variables like pointers are below the buffer.
    - This way, you can’t overflow and replace local function pointers.

![[attachments/Untitled 13 40.png|Untitled 13 40.png]]

## Function prolog and epilog

- In the prolog:
    1. It makes space for the canary on the stack.
    2. Loads the cookie onto `eax`
    3. Performs xor between `eax` and `esp` so that there is a different canary per stack frame.
    4. Stores the canary into the stack.
- In the epilog:
    1. It reads and regenerates the canary from the stack.
    2. Checks if the canary is valid. If not, it will crash the program.
    3. Then moves the stack pointer up to ignore the canary.

# Canary vulnerabilities

- The use of the canary only strengthens the stack.

![[attachments/Untitled 15 36.png|Untitled 15 36.png]]

- You can write C code that is vulnerable despite having canaries in the stack.
    - You might succeed in overflowing a pointer even though things are organized like this.
    - The exploit allows you to kind of jump over a canary.

## Canary extraction

- This a way to circumvent canary protection alltogether.
- When a web server crashes, typically it is restarted automatically.
    - If the web server is a child of another process, it might be relaunched using `fork`.
    - However, this means it does not change the canary after a crash.
- This allows the attacker to slowly extract the canary.
    - They can overflow one byte of the canary at a time, and check whether the program crashes or not.
- The attacker can try 256 different possibilities per byte.
    - With an 8-byte canary, the attacker needs 2048 tries.
    - After crashing the server at most 2048 times, the attacker knows the canary and can overflow the buffer.

![[attachments/Untitled 16 35.png|Untitled 16 35.png]]

- The attacker can use this exact same approach to extract the `ret addr`, which allows them to figure out the ASLR randomness → allows them to do ROP attack.

# More methods

- This is a series of additional defenses to prevent control hijacking.

## Shadow Stack

- This methods separates the data and the control → as long as the attacker does not attack both the shadow stack and the real stack, we are safe.

![[attachments/Untitled 17 32.png|Untitled 17 32.png]]

## Memory Tagging

- Every pointer and its associated memory region shares a 4-bit “tag” → 1 hex character
    - Every time we use the pointer to access the memory region, the tags need to match.
        - If we try to overflow, the tags and the associated region will not match.
    - This is a hardware defense, not software → provides defense for both heap and stack.
- It guarantees that there are no false positives (if it says its an error then its an error)
- It might have false negatives → tags can be reused, so tag may match even if its wrong.

![[attachments/Untitled 18 30.png|Untitled 18 30.png]]

- It prevents both buffer overflows and use after free.
- In the picture below, the tags are the hex numbers above the memory region.

![[attachments/Untitled 19 27.png|Untitled 19 27.png]]

- It prevents use after free because upon freeing, the memory region gets a new tag.

![[attachments/Untitled 20 27.png|Untitled 20 27.png]]

- It can’t catch bugs that are not beyond the 16-byte memory regions.
    - Even though the array has size 40, we can access size 44 since that whole last memory region has the same tag.

## AddressSanitizer (ASan)

- This is a software tool from Google.
    - Typically used when the program is tested to find buffer overflows before deployment.
    - Protects both the heap and the stack.

# Control Flow Integrity (CFI)

- This ensures that you can only call functions/jump into addresses that the complier allows.

![[attachments/Untitled 23 19.png|Untitled 23 19.png]]

![[attachments/Untitled 24 18.png|Untitled 24 18.png]]

- This can implemented using new instructions.
    
    - Every time you jump to an address or call a function, the next instruction must be `EndBranch` → at beginning of every function, needs `EndBranch` instruction
    - This prevents the use of gadgets, since they most likely do not have an `EndBranch.`
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 25 15.png|Untitled 25 15.png]]
    
- However, this method is not foolproof.
    - It does not prevent the attacker from causing a jump to a valid but **wrong** function.
    - It’s also hard to build an accurate control flow graph that is static.
