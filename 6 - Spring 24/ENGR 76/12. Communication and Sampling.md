# Band-limited transmission

- We can use the sampling theorem to help build the signal for our bits.

  

## Using sinc for communication

- The ideal way would be to use sinc interpolation.

- The sinc interpolation give us:
    - Given a bandwidth $B$﻿, it gives the best bit rate.
    - Given an interval $T$﻿ (or bit rate), it gives the smallest bandwidth.

## On-off keying

- This is used because sinc is hard to do in practice.

- The spectrum of this signal is no longer limited, because of the sharp edges.

# Passband Communication

## Upconversion

## Upconversion with on-off keying

- Notice that if we do this, the bandwidth is now double what it was before.
    - This means with a given bandwidth, we halve the bit rate again.
- The graphs below show the spectrum of the baseband signal, and the spectrum of the passband signal.

- Below are a few graphs
    
    - The left graph is the continous time signal of the original bandband signal.
    - The right graph is the continous time signal of the passband signal.

# Decoding at the receiver

- Each bit corresponds with a time slot of the signal.

# Synchronization

- To syncrhonize, we typically send a preamble before the actual signal.
