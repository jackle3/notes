# Recap

- Huffman coding, information sources

- Block coding, entropy rate in limit

- Joint entropy for IID, Shannon’s theorem

- Entropy when not IID

- Having dependence can allow you to beat the theoretical limit $H(X)$﻿

# Signals

- Signal is a function
    - Examples for acoustic, black and white photo, colored photo, videos

# Sine and cosine

- Triangle view, unit circle view

![[attachments/Untitled 12 4.png|Untitled 12 4.png]]

- We can produce the sine and cosine functions w.r.t time if we **rotate** around the circle at a constant speed.

## Sinusoid

- Amplitude, frequency, and initial phase
- Periodic functions → full rotations with $2\pi k$﻿

## Period

- Shortest amount of time before signal repeats.

# Plots of sinusoids

# Sums of sinusoids

- With this function, adding more and more gets us closer to the saw tooth function.
    - The period of the sawtooth is $T = 0.5$﻿ because all the sinusoids have periods of $0.5$﻿

- With this function, we can get the square wave.
