## Prefix-free code

> [!important]  
> The Huffman algorithm constructs the best prefix-free code for any source. It has the smallest @import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.9/katex.min.css')lˉ\bar{l}lˉ﻿ among all prefix-free and uniquely decodable codes.

- We can significantly reduce the $\bar{l}$﻿ by encoding blocks of the sequence at a time.
