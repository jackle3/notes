# 2 Fourier theorem

- Periodic functions can be represented as sums of sinusoids.
    - Each harmonic frequency is simply $f_j = j/T$﻿

## 2.1 Integral

- Integral over one period gives us zero, because it cancels out.

## 2.2 Fourier/Frequency representation

- Specify periodic functions using only amplitudes, frequencies, and initial phases.

## 2.3 Harmonics

- Different musical instruments → each note has same frequency

# 3 Fourier series coefficients

- Generalize Fourier representation using trig identity
    - The other representation was like polar coords.
    - This one is like Cartesian coords.

# 4 Even and odd functions

# 5 Fourier cosine series

- If we have even function, we can simplify Fourier series to include only the cosines.

## 5.1 Spectrum

![Untitled 12 3.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%203.png)

# 6 Finite duration signals

- In real life, signals are not fully periodic → they start and end at a certain time.

![Untitled 13 3.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%203.png)

## 6.1 Periodic extension

- Standard extension, just repeat it on the period.
    - Creates discontinuous function in most cases.

![Untitled 14 3.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2014%203.png)

## 6.2 Even period extension

- Mirror over Y-axis then repeat every $2T$﻿
    - Produces continuous function.

![Untitled 15 3.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2015%203.png)

- Function is also even, so we can use the Fourier cosine series.

![Untitled 16 3.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2016%203.png)

# 7 Discrete time signals

- Sampled sine and sampled cosine functions.

![Untitled 17 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2017%202.png)

# 8 Fourier Cosine Series → Spectrum

- All functions are even.
- No sinusoids.

![Untitled 18 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2018%202.png)

- No shift, $A = 3$﻿, and $T = 1$﻿

![Untitled 19 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2019%202.png)

- Shift up, $A = 1$﻿, $T = 2$﻿

![Untitled 20 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2020%202.png)

- Shift down, $A = 2$﻿, $T = 2$﻿

![Untitled 21 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2021%202.png)

- Shift down, negative amplitude

![Untitled 22 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2022%202.png)

- Sums of two different signals → one slow, one fast

# 9 Project 1b

## 9.1 Part 1

![Untitled 24 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2024%202.png)

![Untitled 25 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2025%202.png)

## 9.2 Part 2

- For the discrete cosine transform, the spectrum will be pretty much the same as the continuous signal.
    - Note that for the DCT computation, the fundamental frequency is chosen as 1 because we want it to plot nicely.
    - For continuous, the fundamental frequency is usually 1/2

![Untitled 26 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2026%202.png)

## 9.3 Part 3

- Same as before but its now 2D.
    - For the signal, we have a 2-dimensional image → value represented by color.

![Untitled 27 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2027%202.png)

- For the first image, there is a wave along the x-direction with frequency one.
    - If you take a horizontal slice, it will look just like the 1-D signal
- For the first image, there is a wave along with x-direction with frequency 2.
    - If you take a horizontal slice, it will again look like the 1-D signal

### 9.3.1 Multiple Components in DCT

- There can be multiple components in the 2-D DCT.
    - Signal will just be addition of each of these separate components.
- In the example below, it’s just the sum of the top right and bottom left signals from above.

![Untitled 29](../../attachments/Untitled%2029.png)

### 9.3.2 2-D DCT (inner product)

- In this signal, it has a single component but it’s now in 2-D.
    
    - There is a frequency in the X, and a frequency in the Y direction.
    - Mathematically, it’s a product of the horizontal and the vertical signals (i.e. product of the bottom left and top right).
    
    ![Untitled 30](../../attachments/Untitled%2030.png)
    
- Below is the Fourier cosine series in the 1-D case.
    
    ![Untitled 31](../../attachments/Untitled%2031.png)
    
- Below is the series in 2-D. Notice that the frequency and time are now vectors.
    
    ![Untitled 32](../../attachments/Untitled%2032.png)
    
    - The sine term at the end is ignored because we are using an even periodic extension.

## 9.4 Part 4

![Untitled 33](../../attachments/Untitled%2033.png)

- Looking at the spectrum, most of the nonzero information are in the top left part.
    - This means that most of the image is low-frequency information.
- In order to do compression, we can discard the high frequency component, and only store the low-frequency stuff.
    
    - This is known as a low-pass filter → only allow low-frequency signals to pass
    
    ![Untitled 34](../../attachments/Untitled%2034.png)
    
- We can also throw away the low-frequency stuff via a high-pass filter.
    
    ![Untitled 35](../../attachments/Untitled%2035.png)
    

### 9.4.1 Lossy Compression

- High frequency components correspond to **edge information** (e.g. with a square wave, the high frequency components are the vertical edges of the square)
    - As such, the high-pass filter will give us the edges and the low-pass will blur the image.
