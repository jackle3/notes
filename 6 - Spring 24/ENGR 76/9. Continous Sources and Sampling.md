# Recap (DFT)

- Recall the problem of wanting to find a Fourier series representation for discrete samples.

1. Remember that samples of faster frequencies repeat the lower frequencies.

1. Remember the odd functions odd functions mirror about the center of a period.

## Solving with linear equations

![[attachments/Untitled 3 11.png|Untitled 3 11.png]]

- We construct a matrix of coefficients (orthonormal by construction).
    - To calculater, we can invert the matrix and quickly calculate it.

- To perform inverse DFT, we can simply use the original matrix.

# Discrete Sources

- So far, we’ve focused on discrete sources.

# Continuous Sources

- We now want to work with continuous sources. These are still sequences, but the values are real number (non-finite).

## Steps to Encode

- The first step is quantization, to turn the continous source into a discrete source
    - Make the symbols have finite values.

- The second step is to compress, just like with the discrete sources.

# Continous Time Series

- We also want to work with time series, such as audio.

## Steps to Encoding

- The first step is to sample from the source.
    - This gives us a continous source (finite sequence of real numbers)

- The second step is quantization.

![[attachments/Untitled 15 8.png|Untitled 15 8.png]]

- The third step is compression.

# Lossy

- Some steps are lossless, while some are lossy.

# Sampling

- Sampling is not necessary a lossy step, as long as we follow some rules.

![[attachments/Untitled 18 5.png|Untitled 18 5.png]]

- Suppose given a source, we use **periodic extension** and assume it has **a limited bandwidth**.

![[attachments/Untitled 19 4.png|Untitled 19 4.png]]

![[attachments/Untitled 20 4.png|Untitled 20 4.png]]

- Use this, we can make the Fourier series sum a finite sum.
    - We know that $f_j = \frac{j}{T} \leq f_{max} = B$﻿

## Sampling Theorem

![[attachments/Untitled 22 3.png|Untitled 22 3.png]]

- If we think about the unknowns and coefficients, we have the below.
    - To solve it, we need at least $N$﻿ equations if there are $N$﻿ unknown.

![[attachments/Untitled 23 3.png|Untitled 23 3.png]]

![[attachments/Untitled 24 3.png|Untitled 24 3.png]]

- Thus, if we sample such that we can get enough equations, we can fully solve every single coefficient.
    - This works because by construction, the system of linear equations for Fourier coefficients $(y(0), y(Ts), y(2Ts), \dots)$﻿ is linearly independent.

# Conclusion

![[attachments/Untitled 25 3.png|Untitled 25 3.png]]

- For example, we can use this idea to perfectly reconstruct an audio signal via sampling.
