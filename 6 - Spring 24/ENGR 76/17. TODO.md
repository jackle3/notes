# Convolution Code (example)

- The output sequence is what we put on the **channel**.

## State Machine View

## Trellis

- Visualizes the state machine over time.
- Each $j$﻿ at the bottom is a time step.

## Encoding with Trellis

- The encoding process is just a path through the Trellis.
- The initial state is `00`, and we pad two zeros to the end to make sure it ends at `00`.
    - The sequence below has 5 info bits and 2 padding bits.

## Why is this useful?

- Small changes in the input sequence leads to large changes in the output → high minimum distance to correct bit flips.
    - In this case, any two output sequences generated by the Trellis will have at least distance five from one another.

## Rate

- This code has slightly lower rate, but has a greater minimum distance.

## Decoding Goal

## Brute Force Decoding

- This works, but is extremely slow → with $k = 100$﻿, will take $10^{13}$﻿ years to decode.

## Viterbi Decoding

- Basically finding the shortest path in a graph, where edge weights are the hamming distance to the received sequence.

- In step 1, we construct the Trellis.

- In step 2, we replace each edge with the cost → Hamming distance of edge label to corresponding chunk of the received sequence.
    - Notice that each edge has cost either 0, 1, or 2.

- In terms of time complexity:
    - This is **linear** in $k$﻿ → the number of information bits we transmit.
    - The number of stages in the Trellis is $k + 2$﻿.
    - For each edge → we do one computation (calculate the Hamming distance).
    - At each stage, there are 8 edges.
    - In total, we do $8(k+2)$﻿ calculations of hamming distance (comparisons are two bit sequences).
