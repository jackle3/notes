# Linear Algebra Recap

- A basis of a space is defined as a set of vectors spanning that space.

- An orthonormal basis has vectors all unit length and orthogonal.

- If we have an orthonormal basis, the coefficients to make up a vector are the projection of that vector onto the basis vectors.

# Fourier Orthonormal Basis

- The Fourier series is an orthnormal basis representation of periodic functions.

## Unit length

- The basis functions are unit length, as shown below.

## Orthogonal

- The basic functions are also orthogonal.

# Fourier Coefficients

- Using what we showed, we can now express the equations for the coefficients.

- These coefficients are effectively the projection of $y(t)$﻿ onto the basis vector.

# Fourier Cosine Series

- Below is a recap of even and odd functions.

## Even Functions

- For even functions, the coefficient for the sine functions are zero, so we are left with only the cosine terms.

- To see this:
    1. $sin(t)$﻿ is an odd function.

    2. The product of an even and odd function is odd.

    3. The product of two periodic functions is (usually) periodic.

    4. Integrals are the same for a periodic function as long as the total duration is still $T$﻿.

    5. The integral of an odd function from $-T/2$﻿ to $T/2$﻿ is zero.
