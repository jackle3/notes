# Recap

- This is the Fourier series representation of periodic functions.
    - If the sum is finite, we call it a finite-bandwidth series.

## Stem plots

- We can use stem plots to represent the value of each coefficient in the sum.

# Discrete Fourier Transform

- So far the signals were constant → we now work with discrete samples of the continous function.

- We want to still represent this discrete time signal as the sum of sines and cosines.

## Fourier Representation

## Duplicate samples (faster frequencies)

- As the frequencies get faster, the samples of a faster sinusoid might match slower sinusoids.
    - In this case, the samples for the frequency `(j + N)/N` is the same as frequency `j/N`

- As such, we can shrink the sum to make it finite.

## Duplicate samples (odd functions)

- Since $sin$﻿ is an odd function, the samples are mirrored and flipped around the center.

# Solving for coefficients

- We can use linear equations to solve for these coefficients.

- Since we have $N$﻿ equations and $N$﻿ unknowns, we can easily solve this with linear algebra.

# Project 1c

- Since every entry is a real number, our codebook would be huge.

## Quantization

![[attachments/Untitled 16 10.png|Untitled 16 10.png]]

- You can use `numpy.digitize()` to perform quantization.
    
    - Be careful of the boundaries!! You should slightly increase your right endpoint so that values equal to the max get into the bucket.
