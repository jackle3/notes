# Communication Systems

## What is information?

- The communication of knowledge.
    - Communication is fundamental in the existence of information

## Telegraph

- First example of modern communication system.
- Communicating short messages via Morse code.
    1. We take the message.
    2. We convert the message to dots and dashes.
    3. The dots and dashes are converted to an eletrical signal.
    4. That signal is relayed via electrical wires.
    5. At the other station, the signal is replayed.
    6. A person listens to the replay and reconstructs the message.
- In the early 20th century, they removed the wires and began communicating between stations using electromagnetic waves → one of the first applications of EM waves.

## Communication Systems

- Analog telephone: A technology for communicating voice over electrical cables.
- An issue with early 20th century understanding was that, even though all the technology was there, there was not a unified understanding of communication systems.
- Shannon started by trying to develop a unified framework for communication design.

## A Mathematical Theory of Communication

- Shannon’s Mathematical Theory of Communication
    - This paper is what started the modern digital information and communication age.
    - Tries to better design communication systems.

  

- He condenses communication into the diagram below.
    - The information source has a message that it sends.
    - The transmitter encodes this message as a signal.
    - This passes through a medium, and is received at the receiver.
    - The receiver decodes the message and sends it to the destination.
- The received signal is **different** from the original signal, because of **noise.**

- Says that: the fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.
    - As engineers, we usually have control over the transmitter and the receiver.

  

## Communication Channels

![Untitled 7 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%207%202.png)

- E.g. we introduce a signal at one end of a cable, it propagates through the cable, and we can measure it at the other end.

  

# Communication Problem

- How can we communicate an audio signal over an electrical cable (or noisy channel)?

## Analog

![Untitled 8 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%202.png)

- We directly send the continous time signal over the noisy channel.
- Pros: pretty simple
- Cons: cannot control noise because we can’t differentiate noise from signal.

## Digital

![Untitled 10 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2010%202.png)

- We encode the signal as bits, and send that.
- Pros: allows us to have perfect reconstruction of bits → only lossy step is quantization

# Digital Transmission

- How do we take a sequence of bits (from the source encoder) and map it to a continous time signal $X(t)$﻿?

## On-off keying

- If it’s a 1, send voltage $V$﻿. If it’s a 0, then no voltage.
    - The only parameters are $T$﻿ (time for each bit), and $V$﻿ (voltage)

![Untitled 11 2.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%202.png)

## Choosing T

- The smaller $T$﻿, the faster our bit rate.

- However, it also increases our bandwidth.

## Why does bandwidth matter?
