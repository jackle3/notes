# Recap: Sampling

- Below is the sampling theorem from last lecture.

## Revisiting Original Formulation

- We can prove the above for the original formulation of the Fourier series too (from lecture 6)

- The stem plot for this series is similar to before, but now combines both sine and cosine coefficients into one.
    - From here, the argument is the same as before.

# Pass-band signals

- These are signals where the minimum frequency is non-zero.
    - We can show that the sampling rate mentioned above also applies here.

- If we apply the theorem above, then the our sampling frequency has to be pretty high.

- However, we can still get away with having a frequency higher than $2B$﻿

# Usefulness of Sampling Theorem

- A lot of signals are finite bandwidth (or we can make it finite bandwidth), allowing us to apply this theorem.

# Interpolation

## Interpolation Function

![[attachments/Untitled 10 10.png|Untitled 10 10.png]]

- The motivation for these properties is that we want our reconstructed function to pass by the sampled values exactly.
    - The only nonzero value in the sum corresponds with $F(k - k) = F(0) = 1$﻿

## Example: Square Function

- Consider the interpolation function below.
    - Notice that $h(t)$﻿, which is the values for the function above, is centered around $m\cdot T_s$﻿

- When we multiply the interpolation function by a value $X(T_s)$﻿, it will vertically stretch it.
- If we sum these up, the function is shown below.
    - The squares are color-coded with each term.

## Linear Interpolation

- Linear interpolation is easy but it will never reconstruct the original function, because it makes sharp edges.

# Sinc function

- The ideal interpolation function is the sinc function. Notice that it is smooth.

![[attachments/Untitled 16 9.png|Untitled 16 9.png]]

- If we use this sinc function as the interpolation function $F(t)$﻿, we can reconstruct exactly if we have enough samples.

# Shannon’s Sampling Theorem

![[attachments/Untitled 20 5.png|Untitled 20 5.png]]

![[attachments/Untitled 21 4.png|Untitled 21 4.png]]

- In the case where the sampling frequency is not enough, it leads to things like aliasing and the stroboscopic effect.

## Color-space transform

- Color images are generally stored as RGB → three channels for each color.
    - We can compress this better if we use the `YCbCr` color scheme → this is a linear transformation of the channels to the **color space.**
    - The `Y` channel is the black and white version of the image → the amplitude of each pixel.
    - There are two more channels, `Cb` and `Cr`.
- Human eyes are less sensitive to some of these channels, so we can compress some of these channels even more.

- We can down-sample the image by subsampling the original blocks of the original image.
