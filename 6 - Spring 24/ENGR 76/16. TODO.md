# Project 2c

- In this project, you implement a convolutional encoder with error-correcting codes.

## Convolutional Codes

- Takes a sequence of information bits and outputs a sequence of bits.

- In this project, we will use a code with a rate of 1/2

## Part 1: Developing the Encoder

- In lecture, we used $p_{2j}$﻿ and $p_{2j-1}$﻿ because it was 1-indexed there.
- In this project, we use $p_{2j}$﻿ and $p_{2j+1}$﻿ because it is 0-indexed in Python.

## Part 2: Evaluating on the simulated channel

- There are two error rates that we compare:
    - BER before the error correcting code.
    - BER after the error correcting code.
- We want to see how well the error correcting code improves.

- At the end, we plot these two BERs and it should look like this
    
    - If we start with a larger BER → after introducing ECC, the BER should reduce.

## Part 3: Integration in Physical Channel

- Typically, with ECCs, the encoded length will be greater than the message length.
- The transmission rate is the rate after applying convolutional encoding.
    - At what rate can our encoded message transmit over the channel?
- The data rate is the rate before, using the original message.
    - At what rate can we send a message of a certain length over time?
