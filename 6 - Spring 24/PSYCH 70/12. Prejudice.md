# Recap

- So far, we’ve talked about 5 reasons why people are prejudiced.

# Hierarchy-Maintenance Perspectives

- Prejudice is related to the maintenance of subversino of the existing social hiearchy.
    - This shows itself in
        - Social Dominance Theory
        - System Jusitification Theory

  

# Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)

- Found by Pratto & Sidanius et. al. (1994)
- Individual difference variable
- Belief that societies should have group-based hiearchy
- Correleated with various prejudicies

## SDO Scale

- Found by Ho et. al. (2015)
- An ideal society requires some groups to be on top and others to be on the bottom
- Some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups
- Group equality should not be our primary goal
- It is unjust to try to make groups equal

  

## Social Dominance Theory

- From the middle top, going clockwise:
    - Group stereotypes, protestant work ethic.
    - The dealth penalty
    - Affirmative action
    - All people created equal

# System Justification Theory

- Various ideologies serve to justify the current social hierarchy
    - SDO, Protestant Work Ethic, Right-Wing Authoritarianism, Fair Market Ideology, Political Conservatism
- People are motivated to justify the current social hierarchy (and therefore are attracted to these ideologies) because this reduces uncertainty
- Prejudice results from threats to the system’s stability or perceived rightness

  

## Antecedents

- Need for order, structure, and closure (+)
- Perceptions of a dangerous world (+)
- System instability and threat(+)
- Openness to experience (-)

  

## Consequences for system justifiers

- **For high status groups:**
    - Increased in-group favoritism (i.e. prejudice)
    - Increased well-being/positive affect
    - Decreased support for social change
- **For low status groups:**
    - Increased out-group favoritism
    - Decreased well-being/positive affect
    - Decreased support for social change

# Prejudice Development

- Prejudice sometimes start from a very young age.
    - The peak on B is around age 7 to [10.](http://10.At) At that point, their stereotypes start to decrease.

- This is because of how status relates to positivity and affinity

# Impact of Prejudice

  

## How: The Basic Process

![[attachments/Untitled 5 144.png|Untitled 5 144.png]]

- Categorization of basic groups happens quickly and automatically (race ~100 ms, gender ~150 ms)
- Once a person is categorized, stereotypes are usually automatically activated
- Application is when the stereotype informs judgement

  

## Effects on judgment

- Evaluations
- Inferences
- Behavior
- Memory
- Particularly when we have little or ambiguous information

  

## Moss-Racusin, 2012

- Nationwide sample of science profs
- Evaluated the application materials of undergrads who ostensibly applied for lab manager job
    - IV: Female or male name
    - DV: hireability, competence, salary

  

- Findings: men had higher rates of competence and hireability, and lab PIs were more willing to mentor men than women.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 6 142.png|Untitled 6 142.png]]
    

  

- Finding: there was a decent relation between gender, competence, and hireability.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 7 138.png|Untitled 7 138.png]]
    

  

- Finding: the salary difference was very significant

# Motivation

- Motivation determines whether stereotypes affect judgments.

![[attachments/Untitled 9 125.png|Untitled 9 125.png]]

  

- People can be motivated to refrain from stereotyping
    - Examples
        - More motivation to refrain
            - Norms
            - Accountability/accuracy
            - Need for cognition
            - Someone has power over you
                - E.g. your boss is Asian
        - Less motivation
            - Prejudice
            - You have power over others

  

## Accountability Example

- They found that when accountability in police increases, the number of discretionary stops of African Americans went down a lot.

# Cognitive Resources

- The ability of people to focus, pay attention, be aware, and not be overwhelmed.
- Activation/Application
    - Fewer Cognitive Resources = More Stereotyping
- Examples
    - An overwhelming amount of information
    - Doing multiple tasks at once
    - Fatigue

  

## Bodenhausen study (1990)

- Participants rated likelihood of guilt of the target in 3 scenarios
    - IV: Target’s group was stereotypically associated with crime or not
    - IV: Participant was a morning person or an evening person
    - IV: Participant did task at 9 a.m. or 8 p.m.

- They found statistically significant differences between stereotypic and nonstereotypic conditions.
    - When they were more tired, they were more likely to rate basde on the stereotype.

  

# Norms & “New Racisms”

- There are changing norms in society.
    - Changes in Princeton trilogy (beliefs measures) over time
    - Explicit bias decreasing over time in surveys
- But still evidence of prejudice
    - **Principle Implementation Gap**- the difference between dominant group member’s egalitarian values and the application of those values in concrete practices

  

- White’s values regarding egalitarian residential choice and school integration has gone up a lot.
    
    - Almost all of them think that we should not have segregation.
    - However, the support for egalitarian policies (such as federal intervention, busing, open housing law) trends much lower than the values.

## Aversive Racism

- A theoretical perspective about when prejudice is expressed
    1. People have outgroup discomfort or anxiety
    2. But are genuinely motivated to be egalitarian
    3. When they don’t know to correct themselves, prejudice leaks out
    4. When the situation is clear (e.g. it’s clear that they are being prejudiced), they exert control over their immediate biased impulses

  

## Personnel Decisions Study

- White college students asked to evaluate candidates for peer program
    - IV: Candidates White or Black
    - IV: Strong, Ambiguous, or Weak Qualifications

  

- Findings:
    
    - In all three decades that the study was ran, when in the ambigious situation (moderate qualification), the prejudice leaked out
        - They prefer white candidate over black candidate.

## Forms of ambiguity

- Weak situational cues
- Inadmissible information
- Less controllable behaviors

  

# Key Questions Summary

- What is prejudice?
    - ABCs of Prejudice, stereotypes
- Why are people prejudiced?
    1. Information Processing
        1. To process information quickly and efficiently
    2. Social Role Theory
        1. We prescribe traits according to group differences we observe
    3. Social Identity Theory
        1. We differentiate according to groups and esteem our own groups highly
    4. Realistic Group Conflict Theory
        1. Competition breeds contempt
    5. Social Regulatory Theory (e.g., Stereotype Content Model)
        1. (Mixed) prejudices help to maintain functioning, durable inequalities
    6. Hierarchy-Maintenance Theories (e.g., system justification, social dominance)  
        1. To satisfy people’s preferences for hierarchies and stably-arranged societies that they can perceive as just (i.e., fair, good)
