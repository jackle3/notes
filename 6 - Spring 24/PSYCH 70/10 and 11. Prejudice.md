# Racial Disparities

- There are disparities in:
    - Education
    - Imprisonment
    - Income
    - Wealth
    - Health
- and many more.

## Explicit and Implicit Bias Trends

- From a study by Charlesworth & Banaji.
- In most cases, the **explicit biases** are going down, though some are showing bias in the opposite direction.

- Implicit biases are also going down, though definitely not as much.
    
    - Some categories like age and disability do not show trends of going down.
    - Body weight is showing trends of increasing biases.

# Key Questions

- What is prejudice?
- Why are people prejudiced?
- What’s the impact of prejudice?
- How can we mitigate prejudice?

## Psychological Study of Race, Other Identities, and Prejudice

- This is not a normative discussion.
- Race, and other social identities, are never themselves causal
    - As treatment
    - As culture
    - As identity
- Studies are not diagnostic of individuals, but reveal general trends
- Not all social identities—and the prejudices involving them—work in the same way
    - E.g. sexism works differently than racism.
- We are all vast and have varying, context-bound, intersectional identities

# What is prejudice?

- The ABC’s of prejudice are **Affect, Behavior, Cognition**.
- **Affect** — our feelings.
    - Positive or negative
    - Weak or strong
    - Can manifest as a range of emotions
- **Behavior** — our actions
    - Helping vs. Harming
    - Approaching vs. Avoiding
    - Verbal vs. Non-verbal
    - Passive vs. Active
- **Cognition** — our thoughts
    - Beliefs and Ideologies
    - Perceptions
    - Stereotypes → Generalized beliefs about a social group.
        - Can be positive, negative, or both
        - Can be inaccurate or accurate _at the group level_
        - Intentional, reasoned, and reflective vs. not
        - You don’t have to personally believe them.
            - _Personal Stereotype:_ traits you think a particular group has
            - _Cultural Stereotype:_ beliefs about how a group is viewed **in society.** You may or may not personally agree with them.
        - Consensual
            - As in consensus → shared consensus for that the stereotype is.

## Katz & Braly Stereotype Study, 1933

- 100 Princeton students
- Provided beliefs about 10 groups (e.g. Germans, Irish, Negroes)
    - Chose 5 traits from 84 adjectives
    - Checked the most typical
- Interested in traits selected and the % of who chose the trait.
- Calculated a uniformity index to capture the consensuality of the stereotype
- Found that Negroes had the highest uniformity index, with low favorability

## Katz & Braly method replications

- **Princeton Trilogy study** — suggested that stereotypes of African Americans were becoming more positive and less consensual over time.

## Devine & Elliot Stereotype Study, 1995

- Made distinction between personal beliefs and cultural stereotype.
- Used checklist method but added additional words.
- Personal beliefs vs. cultural stereotype.
- Measured prejudice.
- The dependent variables were: content, favorability, and uniformity

![Untitled 2 160.png](attachments/Untitled%202%20160.png)

- Findings:
    - Cultural favorability was almost identical between this and K&B study (60 years)
    - Personal favorability was much higher.

## Brown-Iannuzzi et al. (2016)

- Question: according to society, what do welfare recipients look like.
- They usd a reverse correlation task:
    
    - Get “pictures in head”
    - Tell participants to pick image that most resembles a welfare recipient.
    
    ![Untitled 3 157.png](attachments/Untitled%203%20157.png)
    

  

- Findings:
    
    - If they average the faces chosen, we can clearly see the prejudice.

# Why are people prejudiced?

- Information processing (from people perception)
    - Facilitates efficient processing of vast information
    - Rapid, automatic
    - Tracks warmth and competence
    - Steoreotypes provide a quick and automatic way to interact with strangers around us.
        - Allow them to engage in the complex world without having to know every individual out there.
- **Social Role Theory →** people perceive, expect, and conform to observed group differences.
    - Correspondence Bias/Fundamental Attribution Error
        - All those **“types of people” in those positions** must tell me something about how they are (rather than the circumstances acting upon them)
            - E.g. we see that all the women in society are caretakers, so you think that women are more nourshing → instead of thinking about lack of job opportunities for women.
    - Behavioral Confirmation/Pygmalion Effect/Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

## Gender & Social Role Theory

![Untitled 6 147.png](attachments/Untitled%206%20147.png)

  

## Miller, Eagly, & Lynn Study (2015)

- They tested ~350,000 people across 66 countries.
- Question: how is the percentage of female science majors related to gender science stereotypes?
    
    - On the x-axis, we see percentage of women among science majors.
    - On the y-axis we see the explicit and implicit science stereotypes.
    - Findings: The more women there are in science majors, the less science stereotypes there are.

# How do these prejudices begin?

## A Class Divided Study (1970)

- They found that before coming into class, children were already very racially prejudiced.
    - They did not seem to recognize their own prejudice.
- In class, they tried an experiment where she judged people by the color of their eyes.
    - The teacher said to them:
        - “Blue eyed people are the better people in this room”
        - “Blue eyed people are better than brown eyed people”
        - “Brown eyed people do not get to use the drinking fountain”
        - “Blue eyed people get 5 more minutes of recess, while the brown eyed people have to stay inside”
        - “We spent a great deal today waiting on brown eyed people, while the blue eyed people were fast”
        - “Blue eyed people go first to lunch”
        - “Brown eyed people cannot play with blue eyed people”
- The other children were quickly became prejudiced about eye color.
    - The brown eyed kids were really sad about the treatment.
    - Someone called another kid “brown eyes” and they got into a fight.

  

- On the second day, she then told them that “brown eyed people are better than blue eyed”
    - She said the same things as before, but now flipped.
        - “Brown eyed people learn fast”
        - and other things that insinuated that brown eyed people were better

  

- They had a task to go through a set of cards, and she tested it on the brown eyed kids.
    - On the first day, when the “brown eyed people were worst”, it took them 5 minutes.
    - On the second day, when the “brown eyed people were better”, it took them 2.5 minutes.

  

- By the end of the experiment:
    - She asked “Should the color of someone’s skin affect how you treat them? Should you judge someone for their skin?”
        - The children said no.

  

- **Question: why did these children become prejudiced?**
    - The teacher was constantly reinforcing the prejudice.
        - Correspondence bias / FAE
            - Making arbitrary attributions about the whole group based on the children.
            - E.g. if a blue eyed child threw their food away, she said “blue eyed children are wasteful”
        - Self-fulfilling prophecy
            - E.g. if the teacher said “you did that so fast”, the children began to believe they were smart, and began to do it even faster
        - Obedience/Affiliative Social Tuning
            - The children trusted the teacher so they began to hold the same opinions that she expressed

  

# Why prejudice? Social Identity

- **Identity** definition: Different “selves” that an individual may take on in social interaction
    - Individuals have many identities
- Levels of identity
    - Personal identities (personality)
        - Approaches to interpersonal behavior (introverted, polite)
        - Emotional or psychological traits (optimistic, moody)
    - Role identities (roles)
        - Positions in groups (Student, friend, mother)
    - Social identities (groups)
        - Groups to which one belongs (nationality, university, political party)
        - These are
            - meaningful kinds of people in our society, about whom we have stereotypes (e.g., eye color in the world of the video)
            - socially constructed (i.e., a product of our society, not occurring “naturally,” i.e., outside of the context that makes them meaningful)

  

## Social Identity Theory (SIT)

- People categorize selves and others into groups
- These groups provide a social identity that impacts self-esteem
- We want this social identity to be positive, so we **favor our group over other groups**

  

- This theory explains:
    1. How people come to identify with groups
    2. Consequences of group identification

  

- Some principles include:
    - People have a natural tendency to categorize when they see contrast
        - Contrast is necessary for category formation
        - There is no perceiving light without dark
    - There is no group until an out-group is salient
        - There is no perceiving rural without urban, poor without rich

  

## The Accentuation Effect

- Found in the studies by Tajfel (1959) and Tajfel & Wilkes (1963)
- **Goal**
    - To understand the effect of categorization on perceptions of group members
- **Procedures**
    - Participants judged the similarity of physical objects
        - Condition 1: Objects **randomly divided** into sets and explicitly presented as separate groups
        - Condition 2: Objects not divided into sets, presented as one group
- Key Finding
    - In Condition 1, people perceived **greater similarity for objects within sets** and less similarity for objects between sets
    - Group membership accentuates the extent to which we see things as similar

  

## Group Identification

- We tend to identify…
    - With similar others
    - And against dissimilar others
- Reverse is true too. Upon identifying with a group…
    - We see ourselves as more similar to in-group and less like the out-group…
- Group identification comes from…
    - Perceived similarity
    - Presence of dissimilar out-group
    - Salience of group membership in situation
        - E.g. putting collars or other physical markers on different groups

  

- **The consequences of group identification are:**
    - Out-group animosity
        - Perceptions of out-group as evil, immoral, dishonest
    - In-group favoritism
        - Greater liking, respect, cooperation, helpfulness
        - Greater perceived competence, quality of the in-group
        - Feelings of solidarity
        - Biased perceptions of reality
        - Motivated reasoning on behalf of the group

  

## Ratner et al. study (2014)

- Independent variable: randomly assigned participants to groups based on an arbitrary dot estimation task (i.e. showing dots on the screen and have people estimate it)
    - They told people whether they over-estimated or under-estimated the dots.
- Dependent variable: is the depicted person an over-estimator or under-estimator (reverse correlation task)

  

- Findings: they found these average faces.
    - In a later trust game, people were more likely to trust the ingroup than the outgroup.

![Untitled 8 134.png](attachments/Untitled%208%20134.png)

  

- They also find that people rated the ingroup higher than the outgroup.
    - Shows very strong ingroup favoritism.

![Untitled 9 130.png](attachments/Untitled%209%20130.png)

  

## Hacker et al. study (2017)

- They had some Canadian participants.
- IV: participants were primed with personal vs. Canadian identity
- IV: participants randomly tasted honey and maple syrup
- DV: how pleasant does it taste?

  

- Findings: people who got the Canadian prime rated the maple syrup higher.
    
    ![Untitled 10 124.png](attachments/Untitled%2010%20124.png)
    

  

## The Minimal Group Experiment (Tajfel, 1970)

- Participants were ages 14, 15 from Bristol, UK
- They were put into three-person groups.
- They used a trivial criterion (e.g. painting preference) to make groups.
    - Two members were in the ingroup, one member was in the outgroup.

  

- Participants distributed money to self and others (known only by group membership) according to one of three payment schemes
    - Maximum Joint Profit (MJP)
        - E.g., $5, $5, $5
    - Maximum Profit for the Ingroup (MIP)
        - E.g., $5.50, $5.50, $3
    - Maximum Difference (between in and out groups) (MD)
        - E.g., $4, $4, $1

  

- Results
    - Everyone would be best off with MJP
    - But participants favored MIP
    - MIP > MD > MJP
    - People were willing to forgo profits to maximize advantage over the outgroup
- Called “minimal group” because they found the minimal basis for creating in-group favoritism
- Minimal group setting started originally as a control condition…but they discovered they could make groups out of almost nothing

  

# Why prejudice? Realistic group conflict theory

- Prejudice arises when groups compete for the same limited resources.
    - E.g. wars over territory, thinking hat they are stealing “our” jobs

  

## Robber’s Cave Experiment

- Study by Muzafer and Carolyn Sherif (1954)
- Field experiment conducted at Robber’s Cave National Park.
- The participants were:
    - 22 white, middle class boys who were aged 12.
    - In other words, very similar participants in the real world.

  

- Stage 1: Participants randomly assigned to two groups, and groups were totally isolated from one another for 5 days
    - Worked on cooperative, joint tasks, encouraged to identify as a group
    - Each group named themselves
        - The Rattlers
        - The Eagles
- Stage 2: Competition was created
    - Competing for a trophy and medals and pocket knive

  

- The two groups were brought together for first time at dinner
    - Name-calling, “razzing,” singing of derogatory songs
    - Some Eagles didn’t want to eat with the Rattlers
    - Burned each other’s flags, raided cabins
- Researchers arranged for Eagles to win
    - Rattlers stole their medals and pocket knives
    - More name-calling: "stinkers” and "braggers"
    - Almost physical fighting
    - Holding noses around each other
    - Refusal to eat with one another

  

- Stage 3: Integration Phase
    - Lasted over 6-7 Days
    - Several opportunities for reduced tension
        - Film screening
        - Shooting firecrackers on July 4th
        - Bean-collecting contest
    - Found that these opportunities had **No effect**
        - Several events ended in food fights

  

- Created scenarios with superordinate (overarching) goals
    - Non-trivial problems which couldn’t be solved by one group, required cooperation between groups.
    - First, **The Water Problem**
        - Researchers intentionally blocked a critical water faucet
        - Blamed this on “vandals”
        - Boys cooperated to fix it
        - Findings: the tension was somewhat reduced
            - Rattlers let the Eagles go 1st for water since they didn’t have canteens
    - Second, getting a movie
        - Researchers suggested they watch "Treasure Island" or "Kidnapped"
        - But said it would cost $15
        - They agreed to split evenly between the groups
    - Other joint tasks
        - Used a rope on a partly cut-through dangerous tree
        - Apparently stuck-in-a-rut truck that was carrying food for both groups
- Results: Cooperative activites improved group relations
    - Ate together
    - Mixed seating at dinner
    - Decided they wanted to return to Oklahoma City on one bus
        - Cheered when the staff OK’d this
        - Mixed seating on bus
    - At rest stop the Rattlers decided to spend the $5 won in the bean toss contest on  
        malts for everyone  
        

  

- Findings:
    
    - Before the cooperative activity, there were very few boys with friends in the out-group.
    - After the cooperative activity, the percentage increased significantly.
    
    ![Untitled 11 119.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%20119.png)
    

  

- Conclusions
    - Separation and competition can generate inter-group conflict
    - But cooperative pursuit of common goals (and shared success) can foster solidarity, cohesion, and liking
        - Pursuing a common goal creates group identification

  

## Realistic Group Conflict Theory

- There were subsequent experimental support for this theory
- Priming people with scarcity of jobs and competition for them yields anti-immigrant sentiment (Esses et al,. 1998)
- People primed with competition even feel more negatively to unrelated groups (Sassenberg, 2007)

  

# Why prejudice? Social Regulatory Theory

- Stereotypes serve intergroup functions
    - The **content of stereotypes stems from macro structures** (e.g. societal inequality and conflict) and help to maintain the status quo.
        - E.g.
            - justifying groups’ social positions
            - Placating marginalized groups
- Examples include:
    - Stereotype content model
    - Ambivalent sexism

  

## Stereotype Content Model (Fiske, 2002)

![Untitled 12 116.png](attachments/Untitled%2012%20116.png)

- Social structures leads to stereotypes → which leads to emotional prejudices → which leads to discriminatory behaviors → which leads to maintain the status quo and strengthen the social structures.

### Competition related to Perceived Warmth

- The main questions with warmth are:
    - What are the intentions of this group towards my group?
    - Do they want to take our stuff or social status?

![Untitled 13 107.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%20107.png)

![Untitled 14 94.png](attachments/Untitled%2014%2094.png)

  

### Status related to Perceived Competence

- The main questions with competenece are:
    - Can this group carry out its intentions toward my group?
    - How much wealth and status have they attained relative to my group?

![Untitled 15 90.png](attachments/Untitled%2015%2090.png)

![Untitled 16 84.png](attachments/Untitled%2016%2084.png)

  

### Study 1 Details

- Had participants rate a number of social groups on:
    - **Competition** — e.g. more power for them means less power for people like me
    - **Status** — e.g. how prestigious are typical jobs
    - **Competence** — e.g. as viewed by society, how competent, intelligent, confident, etc.
    - **Warmth** — e.g. as viewed by society, how warm, good-natured, sincere, etc.

  

### Study 2 Details

![Untitled 17 78.png](attachments/Untitled%2017%2078.png)

  

### Contributions of Study

  

1. They found that competition and status predict warmth and competence.
    
    ![Untitled 18 71.png](attachments/Untitled%2018%2071.png)
    
      
    
2. They found that we can map quadrants to emotions and discriminatory actions
    
    ![Untitled 19 63.png](attachments/Untitled%2019%2063.png)
    

  

1. They found that we can evaluate ambivalent (mixed) stereotypes.
    
    ![Untitled 20 59.png](attachments/Untitled%2020%2059.png)
    

  

### Stereotype Content Model across Cultures

![Untitled 21 53.png](attachments/Untitled%2021%2053.png)

  

## Ambivalent Stereotyping

- This kind of stereotyping (mixed) increases in countries with more inequality.

![Untitled 22 49.png](attachments/Untitled%2022%2049.png)

  

# Summary

- According to social regulatory theories, prejudices help to justify the status quo, keeping groups in their place while allowing society to stably function
- When groups are unequal and interdependent, ambivalent stereotypes work to justify the inequalities and placate the disadvantaged group
