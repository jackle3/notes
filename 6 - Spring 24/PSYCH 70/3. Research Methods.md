# Why learn about research methods?

- Social psychology is a science.
- To become a more sophisticated consumer or research.
- To do better in this and future courses
- To improve your reasoning about real-life events.

# Steps of scientific method

1. Use questions to develop a claim or a theory.
2. “Operationalize” question by making a testable hypothesis and appropriately defined conditions and variables (i.e. run an experiment!)
3. Derive (modest) conclusions and publish them.
4. Repeat.

# 0. Questions

- The beginning of all good science is a good question.
    - You start by developing a higher level question, then continue to refine it and make it more concrete.
- Where do questions come from?
    - Observations
    - Information that you read
    - Criticisms that you have about something
    - Integration from one domain to the next → application of law into the world, etc

# 1. Theories

- An organized set of principles used to explain observed phenomena.
- Elements of a good theory:
    - Parsimony: the ability to explain in relatively few terms and statements
    - Breadth of phenomena explained
    - Ability to be disproved → can we test the theory?
    - Accuracy of predictions

## Example: Cognitive Dissonance Theory

- Question: What could explain why people continued to follow the Chicago Doomsday cult after the prophecy failed?
    - As an extension, how do people deal with cognitive inconsistencies?
- Theory: Cognitive Dissonance Theory was the theory developed based on the question.
    - Humans have strong tendency towards cognitive consistency
    - Holding apparently incompatible, or logically inconsistent, thoughts about ourselves, others, or the world produces cognitive dissonance.
    - The state of dissonance is uncomfortable.
    - We resolve the discomfort by rejecting or changing one or more of the inconsistent cognitions
    - Dissonance reduction goes on outside of awareness → not a conscious action
- This theory is a good theory because it has all of the four elements.
    - Parsimony → we were able to very clearly convey the theory in just one slide
    - Breadth → there are a lot of very wide applications for the theory.
    - Ability to be disproved → it has been heavily tested, and it can disproved
    - Accuracy → the predictions have been very accurate

## Example: Red Bull

- Question: Does Red Bull “give you wings”?
    - What explains the mass appeal of energy drinks?
- Theory: the effect of a product or substance is not driven by its contents but also its social-psychological context.
    - Red Bull has a huge marketing campaign that has contributed greatly to its increasing appeal.

# 2. Creating a testable study

- “Operationalize” question by making a testable hypothesis and appropriately defined conditions and variables (i.e. run an experiment!)
- How would we turn this into a testable study?
    - What study would you design?
    - What would you measure?
    - What is your hypothesis?

## Example: Red Bull

- We can make the study a blind taste test → give them red bull but without the label.
    - Measure their performance on cognitive or athletic tastes.
    - Ask them if they would still drink it.
    - Maybe ask them to rate it as compared to red bull.
    - Hypothesis: the brand name contributes to differences in the rating.

# 2a. Observational/Correlational Designs

- Goal is to learn about the relationship between two variables as they naturally exist.

    - E.g. as athletic performance increases, Red Bull consumption also increases.
- **Advantages:**
    - Can study the associations of naturally occurring variables that cannot be manipulated or induced.
        - E.g. we can use height as a variable that we study.
    - Can examine phenomena that is difficult or unethical to create for research purposed.
        - E.g. if we are study alcoholism, we can’t induce alcoholism on someone to study it. As such, we would have to use observational designs on existing people.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Correlation is not causation.
        - E.g. if taller athletes have better performance, it might not mean that height causes performance → could be that taller athletes get better training, etc.

## Explaining Correlations

1. Direct causal relationship.
2. Reverse causal relationship.
3. Confounding

# 2b. Experimental Designs

- An experiment: participants **randomly assigned** to different conditions in which the conditions systematically vary on some dimension, all extraneous variables are controlled.
    - In other words, trials are identical except for independent variable (IV).

## Randomization

- Random assignment can account for extraneous or confounding factors, allowing you to make a causal inference → create more comparable groups

## Placebo Controlled Trials

- Suppose we want to learn the pharmaceutical properties of a drug.
- However, the effects of the drug may be placebo.
    - Patient has beliefs and expectations of the effect which are shaped by doctor, past experiences, marketing, etc.
- The changes could also be attributed to natural changes, so we should include a no treatment option.
    - Natural changes that might occur in symptoms regardless of treatment.

- In the example below, the top part is the drug effect. The middle part is the placebo effect. The last part is the no treatment effect of hype.

# 2d. Measures

- Independent Variables (presumed cause):
    - The factors that vary naturally (or are manipulated) to affect the dependent variable
- Dependent Variables (presumed effect):
    - The factors experimenters measure to see if they are affected by the independent variable

## Types of studies

- In the experiment, the reverse causal and the confounded relationships can be removed via random assignment.

## Self-report

- Participants disclose their thoughts, feelings, desires, actions, or anticipated actions
- Advantages:
    - easy, simple, cost-effective
- Limitations:
    - Not always accurate, usually biased in some way.
    - Affected by the way questions are asked.

## Performance/Behavior

- Objective accounts of behavior, e.g. reaction time, accuracy, frequency, etc.
- Advantages:
    - unbiased by self or other report.
- Limitations:
    - Doesn’t necessarily capture psychological elements involved.

## Observer Ratings

- Observers rate a person on a particular quality or behavior.
- Advantages:
    - avoids biases of self-report
- Limitations:
    - Contingent on inter-rater reliability
    - Existence of observation risks altering behavior of the observed person.

## Psychological/Neurological

- Objective measures of the body and brain (e.g. fMRI, hormones)
- Advantages:
    - unbiased by self or other report
- Limitations:
    - Can be costly and/or invasive
    - Interpretation is not always clear

# 2e. Experiment Design Key Considerations

- Internal validity: is the method strong? does it support the inference I am making?
    - Account for extraneous or confounding variables via randomization, control conditions, and control variables.
- Experimental realism: make the experiment as realistic as possible

# 3. Modest conclusions

- The population you sample from can make a major difference
- Randomization (and inference testing in general) works better with larger numbers
    - This is why we need statistics
- Must be derived tightly from the study design.

# 4. Generate questions and Repeat
