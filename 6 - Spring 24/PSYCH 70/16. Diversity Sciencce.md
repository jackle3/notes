# What is Diversity Science?

> [!important]  
> In a radically globalized, interconnected, and interdependent world, what are the psychological, organizational, and societal consequences of difference among individuals?  

  

- **Diversity science** tries to understand the psychological, organizational, and societal consequences of differences among individuals.

  

## Objectives

1. Explore the dynamic definition diversity
2. Evaluate consequences of how and why people might embrace diversity
3. Identify challenges of managing diversity in organizations

  

# Diversity Discourse

- Talking about diversity is a new thing in the context of US history.

- **Results from…**
    - Changing demographics & globalization
    - Reactance to the Civil Rights Movement

  

- **But what is it?**
    - A vague, sometimes self-contradicting concept broadly concerned with differences among people and, sometimes, fairness

  

# When are we diverse?

- Which groups are associated with diversity?
    
    - As seen below, people generally think of minorities when they think of diversity.

## Danbold & Unzueta study (2020)

- Participants viewed the demographic breakdown of two  
    groups in an organization  
    

  

- Questions:
    - How descriptively diverse?
    - How sufficiently diverse?

  

- Answers determined by
    - group membership, identification, & status
    - SDO → social dominance orientation → an individual's support for social hierarchy
        - People with more SDO have a lower threshold for what they consider diverse
    - Concerns about discrimination
        - People with concerns have higher thresholds for what they consider diverse → need to see more of minority

  

- Findings:
    - Notice that the White line is shifted left of the Black line → we need a higher percentage of black individuals in order for people to think its diverse.

# Why value diversity? (Diversity Rationales)

- When we talk about this question, we talk about **diversity rationales**
- There are two types of rationales: moral and instrumental.

  

- **Moral**
    - Diversity commitments arise from intrinsic values or are intrinsic values
    - Often focused on fairness and/or justice
    - E.g., “DIVERSITY IS FAIR. It ensures that individuals from different groups get similar opportunities and reduces concerns about discrimination. It also promotes group equity in the long run.”

  

- **Instrumental**
    - Diversity is a means to an end; it benefits or improves something
    - The business case
    - The learning case
    - E.g., “DIVERSITY IS GOOD. It ensures different perspectives and enables creative problemsolving. It also promotes good leadership skills and citizenship in the long run”
        - Diversity helps you to _do something else_

  

- These rationales change who we think about when we think about diversity
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 4 143.png|Untitled 4 143.png]]
    
    - The y-axis is the percentage of times people listed categories other than federally protected groups (e.g. race, gender, etc).
    - Measured how much participants thought of non-federally protected groups and how well they prioritized a Black job applicant as a function of an organization’s diversity rationale.

  

- Generally, **instrumental rationales** prevail.
    
    - Instrumental rationales predominate in corporate and higher ed contexts, and they are uniquely preferred by and understood as **advantageous for majority groups**
    - Moral rationales are more advantageous for minority groups.
    
    ![[attachments/Untitled 5 141.png|Untitled 5 141.png]]
    

  

- How might instrumental rationales advantage majority groups?
    - Broadened definition of diversity more greatly accommodates majority group members (and their group-based interests)
    - Omission of inequality and disadvantage obscures the need for doing something about it

  

## White-Black Graduation Rate Disparity

- Measured rationale use on websites of 188 universities
- Assessed relationship to student graduation rate disparities
- **Result:** Disparities for underrepresented groups increased most with low levels of moral use

# How to treat difference? (Diversity Ideologies)

- **Colorblindness →** Ignore group differences
    - Preferred by White more than minority Americans
    - Leads to
        - Less positive evaluations of minorities
        - Lower detection of discrimination
        - Less stereotyping

  

- **Multiculturalism →** celebrate group differences
    - Leads to
        - Greater feelings of power and voice among minorities when interacting with Whites
        - Greater feelings of engagement and lower feelings of threat in a workplace for minorities
        - Greater stereotyping of outgroups

  

# Managing Diversity in Organizations

  

## Hiring Discrimination

- Measured using audit studies
    - Send **identical resumes** to employers, just varying the identity of the applicants

  

### Bertrand & Mullainathan (2004)

- Sent fictitious resumes to jobs posted in Boston & Chicago newspapers, **varying how White or Black the applicants’ names seemed**
- White applicants received 50% greater callback rate
- Discrimination rates did not differ by
    - Job sector
    - Job saying they were an “Equal Opportunity Employer”
- Only resumes from applicants with White (and not Black) names benefitted from stronger resumes
    - Indicates that people reading the resumes don’t even pay attention to the details of the resume once they realize the name is Black.

  

### Pager (2003)

- Studies the Impact of Race & Criminal Record on Job Call Backs

### Audit Studies Over Time

![[attachments/Untitled 8 126.png|Untitled 8 126.png]]

  

### Kang study (2016)

- Penalties to Minority Applicants Accrue Even When Orgs Say They Value Diversity
- Minorities sometimes strategically whitened resumes to get hired
- In an experiment, organizations saying they valued diversity reduces resume whitening
- However, an audit study showed orgs that value diversity still penalize minority applicants resumes that are not whitened

# Addressing Discrimination & Inequality in Organizations

  

- One of the main ways is **Diversity Training.**
    1. Temporary experience
    2. Targeted at individuals
    3. Organization bound

  

## Chang study (2019)

- Diversity Training does not always work.

  

- ~3,000 employees randomly assigned to 1-hr lesson either on
    - their own bias, how bias works in the workplace, and how it can be overcome stereotyping
    - Psychological safety and active listening

  

- Findings:
    
    - Notice that all the significant effects were for women participants only (in the yellow)

## Issues with diversity in organizations

- Can we Change Organizations to make them more diverse?
    - Inconclusive Results
        - Improved job satisfaction and org perceptions among minorities
        - Better climate and hiring of women
        - Better gender & racial diversity when voluntary; worse when mandatory
    - Reactance hamstrings impact

  

## Countervailing Consequences

- The mere presence of diversity initiatives, regardless of their efficacy, can have **opposite from desired consequences** by communicating
    - Fairness signals
        - In this organization, things are fair for minorities, and majority group members may be subject to “reverse racism” → minorities racist against majority.
    - Inclusion signals
        - In this organization, minorities are valued and their belonging prioritized over majority group members’
    - Competence signals
        - In this organization, minorities need handouts and are not sufficiently qualified or capable on their own

  

## Kirby, Kaiser, & Major Study (2015)

> [!important]  
> Having awards for diversity increase support for unfair procedures.  

- Procedure:
    - Unstandardized (unfair) vs. standardized (fair) interviewing
        - Standardized interviewing reduces hiring disparities
    - In both conditions, people rate the standardized process as more fair to minorities

  

![[attachments/Untitled 11 113.png|Untitled 11 113.png]]

  

  

- To similar effect, organizational diversity signals discredit minority discrimination claims and bolster “reverse discrimination” claims

  

## Zero-Sum Perceptions of Racial Progress

- A prevailing belief that progress for minorities inherently comes at the **cost of the majority group**
- This zero-sum perception hamstrings the success of diversity measures.

# Conclusions

- “Diversity” is a broad, malleable construct whose malleability is a product of reactance
- This breadth allows it to either disrupt or facilitate the status quo
- Diversity efforts are similarly constrained by the prospect of reactance fueled by zero sum beliefs
- Progress toward equitable social conditions is an unsteady march
