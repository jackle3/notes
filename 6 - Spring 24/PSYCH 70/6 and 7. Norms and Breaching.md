Week: Week 4
---
- Rob, as a TA, stood in front of the lecture hall while the professor sat in the audience.
    - Social norms:
        - This was a breaching of social norms, since he was an undergrad at the front.
    - Cognitive dissonacne:
        - Person who knew him came up with a story to make sense of the situation.

# Norms

- Social “rules” governing what behaviors are appropriate and acceptable in a particular social context.
- Two major kinds:
    - **Descriptive** norms: patterns of behavior that are common, normal, and popular.
    - **Injunctive** norms: patterns of behavior that are commonly approved of and evaluated positively, and violations are disapproved of.
        - Also known as perspective norms.

## Descriptive and Injunctive Norms

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**Descriptive**|**Not Descriptive**|
|**Injunctive  <br>  <br>**|- Driving on the right side of the road  <br>- Taking turns in conversation  <br>- Standing in line properly → queue up at the back of the line|- Not sharing streaming accounts  <br>- (there is a descriptive norm to share accounts)  <br>- Slow traffic on the right  <br>- (not widely practiced, but approved)  <br>- Phone use in conversation  <br>- approved but not common because ppl are addicted to phones|
|**Not Injunctive**|- Fashionable clothes  <br>- Wearing backpacks with 1-strap vs 2-strap  <br>- Gender norms for asking people out|- Food choices  <br>- Name choices|

- Most injunctive norms are also descriptive.

## Breaking Norms

- Breaking **descriptive** norms is seen as strange, surprising, weird
- Breaking **injunctive** norms is seen as wrong, typically met with disapproval, sanctioning
- These types of norms are often overlapping.
    - Injunctive norms are usually descriptive.
    - Descriptive norms often become injunctive (naturalistic fallacy, is-ought fallacy)
        - Things that are typical tend to become natural (i.e. you ought to do it bc its normal)
- **Normative Influence:** Using social norms to guide behavior.

# Morals

- Beliefs about what is right and wrong that are strongly held as universally applicable, viewed to be correct, and backed by emotion.
    - E.g. emotion-backed moral reactions to unequal treatment, cruelty, disloyalty, impurity
- Morals are not always backed by societal consensus.
    - E.g. politically and culturally divisive issues.

# Norm Breaching

- **Breaching:** the purposeful breaking of social norms (usually descriptive, sometimes injunctive)
    - Useful for:
        - Identifying what is and is not a norm.
        - Studying how norms are maintained, and how people react to their breach.

## Examples of Breaching

# Reactions to breaches

![Untitled 2 154.png](attachments/Untitled%202%20154.png)

1. The person doing the breach will sometimes find it almost impossible to do.
    - This is because of **norm internalization**, since we’ve been enforcing it on ourselves for a very long time.
2. The person doing the breach may be gently brought back in line.
    - People might bring you back to appropriate behavior to **maintain the social fluidity.**
3. The person might be sanctioned.
    1. People actively enforce the norm that the person is breaching.
4. The person might be imitated.
    1. The norm is unpopular, so people don’t follow it and imitate the breacher.

# 1. Norm Internalization

- Difficulty of breaching offers insight on norm enforcement.
    - People often “self-sanction” for deviance.

![Untitled 3 151.png](attachments/Untitled%203%20151.png)

- People internalize the feeling that they are being watched → adhere to norms even with no one watching.
    - We watch ourselves → you can blush and get embarrassed when alone

## Social order

- Norm internalization is a **critical part of the social order**
    - We cannot watch one another constantly to uphold norms.
    - The capacity for shame, guilt, embarrassment are important for social order.
    - The more embarrass-able a person is, the more trustworthy, cooperative, and monogamous they are.

## NYC Subway Breach Example

- Study by Stanley Milgram (the guy who did the Milgram obedience experiment)
- Has his students ride the NYC subway trains and ask riders for their seats.
    - Students reported diverse reactions: weird looks, frequent compliance.
    - But they also reported great stress while doing it.
- **The subway is very regulated by social norms.**

## How does it happen?

- Repeated conformity shapes beliefs and preferences.
- Dissonance reduction with environment.
    - Kind of like the insufficient justification cognitive dissonance studies → when people did something undesirable, and they privately endorse it as justification for why they did.
- Much of the apparent conformity actually has roots in socialization.

## **Bennington college study (Newcombe)**

- Did surveys of undergraduate students to measure their endorsement of liberal ideas.

# 2. Maintenance of social fluidity

- Norm breachers are “gently brought in line” to maintain fluidity of interactions.
- **Erving Goffman** proposed “Dramaturgical Analysis”
    - Social order maintained like a play.
    - Gently encourage conformity.
    - Or accommodate deviance.
        - e.g. Emily Post says that if a dinner host sees deviance in their guests, the host should also do what the guest is doing → normalize the guest’s behavior in order to be a good host.

## Backstage

- Everything is not the “front stage” → there are things we do not share to others.
- People might have a backstage → a place where they talk about their real feelings.
    - People anonymously send in postcards with secrets from their lives.

---

# 3. Sanction

- This is the most common response for breaking injunctive norms (norms that are common approved of, and violations are disproved of).
- Other people actively enforce the norm, publicly disproving of the norm breacher.

---

# 4. Imitation

- Most likely to occur when the norm is privately unpopular → people don’t like it, and they agree with breaching the norm.
    - This might occur if “nobody cares about the norm”.

## Cascades

- When deviance is imitated, it can trigger a cascade.
    - Increasing numbers of people adopting a previously rare practice → norm breaching.
    - In a cascade, few people can have a big effect.
- Cascades have some interesting properties
    - Very sensitive to influence of “early movers” → first few people who break norms.
    - Sequencing of behavior has to be just right.
    - Outcomes are hard to predict.
    - It can destroy a norm, or create a new norm.

## Example: Emperor’s New Clothes

- An emperor is told that being naked is a symbol of royalty, and the common people are educated to follow that → complement the emperor’s “clothes” even though there is none.
- A child who has not been educated about it calls the emperor out, laughing at him for being naked and not wearing any clothes in public.
- This triggers a cascade, as other common people imitate the child’s breach to call out the unpopular norm of the emperor’s clothes.

## Threshold Models of Collective Behavior

- Paper by Granovetter (1978).
- Assigns numeric “thresholds” to individuals.
    - **Threshold = number of others who must join a collective behavior before an individual will join.**
- Outcomes of threshold models are very sensitive to distribution of thresholds.
    - Especially presence/absence of potential early movers → makes then highly unpredictable.

![Untitled 5 143.png](attachments/Untitled%205%20143.png)

- In the example above, each row is a world. The number on each person is their threshold.
    - The early movers are the ones with zero and one → they adopt the behavior and begin the behavior right away.
    - As each threshold gets met, more people adopt the behavior.
    - Blue means they adopt the behavior, black means they won’t adopt it.
