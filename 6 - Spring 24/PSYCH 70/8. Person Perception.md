- **Person Perception:** forming impressions about other people.
    - We focus on two big questions about this:
        - How good are we at it?
        - How/why do we do it?

# First Impressions

- One of the biggest factors of first impressions is **appearance**.
    - People generally make up their mind about a person within the first 15 seconds of meeting them.
- For interview candidates:
    - The perception of a person is heightened based on demeanor and confidence.
        - The voice of the person, the eye contact of the interview.
    - The first impression is super important.
        - It takes 8 pieces of positive information before you can overcome a negative first impression.

# “Thin Slicing”

- **Thin Slicing:** The fact that we can make very brief observations and come to a conclusion about who a person is and how they are as a person.
- These judgments happen rapidly, and are surprisingly accurate in practice.
    - Great predictors of human behavior.
- **Ambady & Rosenthal study (1992-1993):**
    - Gave students 6-15 second videos of teacher with no sound and asked them to rate them.
    - These ratings correlated with the teacher’s ratings at the end of the semester.
- **Rule & Ambady study (2011):**
    - Found college graduation photos for managing partners from American Lawyer’s top 100 firms for 200
    - Had students rate the photos on power (competence, dominance, maturity_
    - The perceived power from the photos correlated with actual profits for the lawyer (20 to 50 years later).
- **Todorov study (2005):**
    
    - Gave voters pictures of two candidates that they did not know, and asked them to predict the competence of the candidate.

- **Carrere & Gottman study (1999):**
    - 124 newlywed couples videoed while discussing ongoing conflict
    - Observers judgments from first 3 minutes predicted which couples were divorced six years later
- More examples of thin slicing

## Demographic differences in Thin Slicing

- Different groups tend to be more accurate with thin slicing than others.
    - Extravert’s judgments were more accurate than introverts.
    - Women were more accurate than men.
- The motivation also matters.

### Mating Interest

- When women were closer to ovulation, they were remarkably better at judging whether a guy was homosexual or heterosexual.
    - The accuracy is much higher int he center in the graph on the left.
- Moreover, when women were primed with some mating-related material, they were also more accurate with guessing whether they were homosexual or heterosexual.

# Why do we make impressions so rapidly?

![Untitled 3 155.png](../../attachments/Untitled%203%20155.png)

- The quick judgments that we make help us navigate the world.
    - If we see an angry person on the street, we’d likely try to avoid them.
    - If we see a scared person on the street, we’d likely look around to see the source of fear to determine if we are safe or not.

# Facial Expressions

# Nonverbal Cues

- An essential part of the signal that we provide people that allows us to make quick judgments / thin slice about one another.

# Cross Race Effect

- This effect is shaped by context, different between groups.
    - If a person is in a majority group, the cross race effect is weaker since people are more exposed to that group.

# Universal Dimensions of Social Cognition

- The two main dimensions are warmth and competence.
    - The warmth of a person tells you if they are trustworthy, moral, friendly…
        - Is the person likely to hurt me?
    - The competence of a person tells you if they are resourceful, intelligent…
        - Does the person have the capacity to hurt me?

## Asch study (1946)

- In the study, they gave participants two conditions.
    
    - Two sets of traits that are the same except for **warm** and **cold**.
    
    ![Untitled 8 132.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%20132.png)
    
- Then, they asked about traits that they did not mention.

# Confirmation Bias

- A preference for information that is consistent for a preconception rather than information that challenges it.

## Snyder & Swann study (1978)

- Participants were given a “Get-Acquainted” interview.
    - Participant were told the partner was either introverted or extraverted.
    - They were then told to select questions to use for the interview.
- The study found that the questions chosen were ones that would confirm what they were told about the partner.

# Pygmalion Effect

- High expectations lead to improved performance in a given area and low expectations lead to worse performance.

## Behavioral Confirmation

- When perceivers’ expectations about a target’s behavior creates that behavior among the target
