## Measures

# Social Influence: 100 Years of Research

- What is special/distinct about the particular type of influence studied?
- What do you think you would have done if you were a participant in the study?
- How does this influence show up in “real life”? What are the upsides/downsides of this type of influence?

# First Conformity Experiment (Allport)

- participants told to rate unpleasant norms in groups or alone
- reduced less extreme judgements with a group than with alone
- instinctual submission to the group

# Sherif Autokinetic Experiments

![Untitled 4 148.png](attachments/Untitled%204%20148.png)

- interested in how groups come together to uniformity
- moving illusion with the white light on black background - ambiguous
- Notice that as an individual, it’s in the extremes. However, as you go from group to group, it converges onto an answer.
    - individual -> group, initial diversity followed by convergence
    - group -> individual, quicker convergence, which persists when individuals are separated!
    - thoughts we obtain in presence of other can endure even afterwards

## Convergence

## Informational influence

# Muller-Lyon Illusion

- These two lines are the same length, but the illusion makes it seem different.

![Untitled 9 126.png](attachments/Untitled%209%20126.png)

- This illusion is culture-bound.

# How does social influence show up in real life?

![Untitled 10 120.png](attachments/Untitled%2010%20120.png)

- upsides: easy, saves you time
- downsides: momentum built in shared representations, people aren’t always right, generates and preserves culture

# Asch Conformity Experiments

- In this trial, participants were asked to match the stick on the left with one of the sticks on the right.
    - tested how far social influence could go
    - tested stimuli that were FAR from ambiguous, asked to determine which line was the shortest
    - people conform to the group even if they feel they are wrong
    - give in to see the world in the group’s perspective

## Normative influence

![Untitled 12 113.png](attachments/Untitled%2012%20113.png)

![Untitled 13 104.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%20104.png)

## Why?

- clinical trials - participants conformed a disproportionate amount
- 3 reasons for conformity: action (don’t want to seem different), judgment (i’m wrong), perception (i saw what majority saw)
- informational & normative (social norms, want to get along with group) conformity, draws on our need to be LIKED
- having a partner “punctured” the group’s power
- conformity drops when writing private responses
- study admittedly unlike anything in real life
- thus this study shows an underestimation of what occurs in more mundane cases

# Example: Judges

- On a panel with more democratic colleagues, the republican appointee had more liberal votes than the democratic appointee on the republican panel.
    - judges who are conservative will act more like their liberal colleagues in liberal majority, and vice versa

## Why?

- conformity moderates views, possible reciprocity
    - If I don’t disagree with you here, will you promise that you won’t disagree with me here?
    - group polarization amplifies

# Informational influence

- Using social information about the stimuli to form judgments.
    - Used when stimulus is ambiguous.
- Draws on our desire to be right and competent.
- Seen in the Sherif Autokinetic Experiments → light on dark background, ask people how far its moving.

# Normative influence

- Using social norms to guide behavior.
    - Used when stimulus is not ambiguous.
- Draws on our need to be liked → conform with others in the group.

# Pluralistic Ignorance

- The state in which people in a group mistakenly think that their own individual thoughts, feelings, or behaviors are different from those of the group.

# Obedience Study (Stanley Milgram)

- Dissertation was a replication of Asch conformity studies in Norway and France.
    - He was curious to understand the recent phenomenon of provoking the Holocaust
        - Answers the question: Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices were just following orders?
- Tests whether people would blindly follow orders of an authority figure.
    - Subjects sit in front of a machine, and getting answers wrong shocks someone else on the other side of the machine.
    - When the subject shows hesitation, an authority figure tells them: the experiment requires that you continue.
- **Results:** finds that people do indeed just blindly follow orders.
    - Shifts the blame to the other person. The subject says that the other person could’ve just pulled themselves out if they were in that much pain.

## Obedience

- **Obedience:** compliance with the directives of an authority figure telling the what to do.
    - There were many attempts to find which individuals would not comply, but no reliable answers.

- Notice that in the graph above, all the factors are situational.
    - The more social interaction there is, the less likely a person is to comply.

## Obedience in Real Life

## Lesson

- “This is, perhaps, the most fundamental lesson of our study: ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terribly destructive process”

# Studying Social Influence in 21st Century

**Three advancements:**

- Greater focus on positive interventions
- More nuanced distinctions
- More sophisticated measures

## Influence

- **Relate**
    1. Reciprocation
    2. Liking
    3. Unity
- Persuade
    1. Social Proof
    2. Authority
- Motivate
    1. Consistency
    2. Scarcity
- All of these are:
    1. Sub-liminal, automatic, effortless processes
    2. Resistance strategies to these all involve an awareness of what's happening.

# Affiliative Social Tuning

- We tune ourselves to think, act, believe, and see the world similarly to those we want to relate to → we strive to share reality with them.

## Ambient Regional Bias & Structural Outcomes

- These regional implicit attitudes are predictors
    - Country-level: implicit gender bias correlates with larger 8th grade gender gaps.
    - State-level: implicit age bias correlates with worse health outcomes among the elderly.
    - Local-level: implicit racial bias correlates with:
        - White-black gaps in school discipline and standardized testing.
        - Less upward mobility for Black children.
        - Greater disparities in both traffic stops & police use of lethal force.

## Experiment: Zaki

![Untitled 18 69.png](attachments/Untitled%2018%2069.png)

- Participants were asked to rate a person, and then after, they were given social information about the attractiveness of the person (e.g. “other people rated them an 8”)
    - This social information was randomized.
    - As a result, the participants changed their rating and also how they rated people later on.
        - Changes how the person’s brain responds to it.

# Conclusions
