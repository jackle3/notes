- The information on political psychology is rarely published.
- When you publish, it eliminates the value of the research because everyone now knows it -> people can’t use the research for gains.
- As a result, political consultants sometimes have a stronger grasp of the psychology than academia and research.

# Political Psychology

- Area of study focused on the psychological bases of political attitudes and behavior
    - Connects social psychology and political science
- Main points
    - How political psychologists explain political attitudes, behavior
    - Specifically, how they understand the problem of **polarization**
    - Ideas that they have for reducing polariziation

## Key Terms

- **Party identification**
    - The formal political organization an individual most supports and feels connected to.
    - Political psychologists think of party identification as both:
        - A group membership in the world -> you register to the party, vote in the party
        - An internal social identity -> you identify with the party
    - E.g. Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians
- **Political Ideology**
    - A set of ideas, beliefs, values, attitudes, and preferences about government, policy, and society
    - E.g. liberal and conservative, “left” and “right”
- There is a big distinction between party identification and political ideology
    - Though they are both pretty stable over time.
    - Currently, there is huge correlation between party and ideology

# Topic Focus: Polarization

- There are a few major dimensions/types of polarization:
    - Affective
        - How people feel about parties, people in other parties
        - The extent to which, in a society, two political groups **dislike** each other.
    - Attitudinal
        - What are their attitudes, about the user of government, change, etc
        - The extent to which, in a society, two political groups **disagree** with each other about politics.
- There are also major levels of polarization
    - Polarization in the **mass**
    - Polarization in **politicians**
- If we combine this, there are **four types of polarization**
    - **Affective polarization in the Mass Public**
        - How much the public **dislikes** people in the other party.
    - **Affective polarization in Politicians**
        - How much politicians **dislike** other politicians from opposing parties
    - **Attitudinal polarization in the Mass Public**
        - How much the public **disagrees** with people in the other part
    - **Attitudinal polarization in Politicians**
        - How much politicians **disagree** with other politicians from opposing parties

## Affective Polarization in Mass Public

- 40% of partisans are upset if a child married person from another political party
- 42% view supporters of the opposing party as “downright evil”
- 20% (D) and 16% (R) think that the country would be better off if large numbers of the opposition died.

- The warmth for **in-group** feeling has been pretty stable
    - People like others in the same party
- The warmth for **out-group** feeling has been decreasing a lot
    - People are disliking people in other parties more over time
- **Summary**: affective polarization in the mass public is **increasing**

## Affective Polarization in Politicians

- Political psychologists used a ML model to rate the toxicity of tweets and speeches belonging to politicians in Congress.
    
    - They found that over time, the **toxicity of tweets** from the average congressperson has **increased significantly**.
    - They also found the **toxicity of congressional speeches** has been **decreasing** over time.
    
    ![Untitled 1 158.png](../../attachments/Untitled%201%20158.png)
    
- The most toxic twitter user that they analyzed was Donald Trump.
    
    ![Untitled 2 157.png](../../attachments/Untitled%202%20157.png)
    
- **Summary**: affective polarization in politicians is **increasing**
    - This is because they want to get votes, and they do so through negative campaigning because of the increase in affective polarization in the public.

## Attitudinal Polarization in the Public

![Untitled 3 154.png](../../attachments/Untitled%203%20154.png)

![Untitled 4 149.png](../../attachments/Untitled%204%20149.png)

- **Summary**: Attitudinal polarization in the public is **increasing** among the highly **engaged**

## Attitudinal Polarization in Politicians

![Untitled 5 146.png](../../attachments/Untitled%205%20146.png)

- This can also be seen in data:
    
    - The DW Nominate scores quantifies the ideological positions of U.S. Congress members on a liberal-conservative scale based on their roll call voting behavior.
    
    ![Untitled 6 144.png](../../attachments/Untitled%206%20144.png)
    
- **Summary**: Attitudinal polarization in politicians is **increasing**

# Reducing Affective Polarization

- Recall that affective polarization is the extent to which two groups _dislike_ each other.

## Partisan Animosity Study (from Robb’s Lab)

- Crowdsourced ideas from people.
    - Accepted ideas that could be fit into a survey in <8 mins.
    - Topics that they were targeting: affective polarization, anti-democratic attitudes, support for political violence.
- Recruited ideas from academics, practitioners, and anyone willing to give an idea.
    - There were 252 submissions, from 419 submitters, from 17 countries.
        - The fields that these submissions come from were: psychologists, political scientists, practitioners, sociology, communications, economics.
- They tested 25 ideas.
    - Evaluated the likelihood of success, and novelty of the idea.

### **Study Procedure**:

- There were `n = 32,059` participants in the study, with 25 different independent variables.
    - Example item: “We would like to get your feelings toward both Democrats and Republicans. We would like you to rate them using something we cal the feeling thermometer. How would you rate Republicans/Democrats?”

![Untitled 8 131.png](../../attachments/Untitled%208%20131.png)

### **Findings:**

- Contact Project: Participants shown a video designed to show examples of people they disagree with being respectable and explaining the reasons for their belief. It also showed that they were respectful of the participant, despite the different views.
    - This reduced polarization the most
- Media Trust: Video saying the idea of mass polarization is pushed on us by the mass media. Asserted a common identity on all people to resist the media.
    - Reduced polarization the second most.
- In the graph below, the more left, the more it reduced partisan animosity.
    
    ![Untitled 9 127.png](../../attachments/Untitled%209%20127.png)
    

### **Key Strategies of successful ideas to reduce polarization:**

- Sympathetic exemplars
    - E.g. interacting with a person of the other party
- Emphasizing common identities
    - E.g. a national patriotic identity

# Theories of Political Psychology

- We can sort all theories into two buckets.
- Symmetric theories — people in different groups are treated as similar.
    - E.g. the psychology of liberals and conservatives are in many ways the **same**.
    - This is used to study in-group and out-group ideas, group belonging, etc.
    - This does not care about what group and what the group identity is.
- Asymmetric theories — people in different groups have different psychologies.
    - E.g. the psychology of liberals and conservatives are in many ways **different**.
    - E.g. The Authoritarian Personality (Adorno, 1950)
        - People in authoritarian policies are obedient to people superior to them, and dominate to people below them.
        - This parallels the Social Dominance Orientation (shown in Lecture 11)
    - Idea that personal traits are associated with political ideology persist

## Personality Predictors

- Liberals tend to be higher in openness to experience, tolerant to ambiguity, low in need for cognitive closure (Jost, 2003)
    - These traits are opposite for conservatives. This makes sense: the status quo is known, certain, stable (for most), and change requires openness.
        - Most associated with political views on social issues (e.g. race, gender, sexuality, family, religion).
- This was also the best predictor of political ideology on OKCupid.
    - They would ask questions to find political ideology: e.g. “Do you prefer people to be more simple or complex?”
        - Liberals would want complex individuals, and conservatives would want simple.

## Moral Foundations Theory

- Moral values help explain political ideology and polarization
    - Leading asymmetric theory of the time.
- They find that liberals and conservatives tend to hold different values.
    
    - Liberals care about fairness/equality and harm/care.
    - Conservatives care about in-group/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity.
    
    ![Untitled 10 121.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2010%20121.png)
    
- You can leverage this asymmetric in the underlying moral values to make more persuasive messages.
    
    ![Untitled 11 117.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2011%20117.png)
    

  

  

- Political divides based in moral conviction are **uniquely hard to address**
    - Foster resentment and anger
    - Make compromise difficult
    - Impair taking the perspective of others
    - People tend to make arguments in terms of their own moral values

  

- Link between morality and politices also offers a route to political influence
    - **Moral reframing hypothesis**: Reframing a position in terms of an audience’s moral values can lead to increased support

  

### Feinberg & Willer Study (2015)

- People use the values associated with their party when persuading others.

![Untitled 12 114.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2012%20114.png)

  

  

### **E.g. Same-Sex Marriage**

- If you want to convince conservatives to support same-sex marriage, we can use one of their underlying moral values to convince them.
    
    ![Untitled 13 105.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2013%20105.png)
    

  

- They tested arguments that were reframed to conservative values:
    
    - E.g. same-sex marriage couples are patriotic
    
    ![Untitled 14 92.png](../../attachments/Untitled%2014%2092.png)
    

  

- **Findings**: when conservatives saw these kind of appeals, they tend to support it more.
    
    - If we use the loyalty moral value, conservatives support same sex marriage more than before.

# Conclusions

- Political psychology invokes symmetric and asymmetric explanations
    - Asymmetric for which ideologies, group identities people hold
    - Symmetric for the effects of having an ideology, group identity

  

- Key distinctions in forms of polarization
    - Most, but not all, forms of polarization are growing

  

- To reduce polarization:
    - Affective polarization
        - Strategies: Sympathetic exemplars, Emphasizing common identities
    - Attitudinal polarization
        - Dual motivations: partisan, bipartisan
        - Strategy: Moral reframing

  

- **Social Change Strategies**
    - But all this reflects persuasion-based social change strategies that predominate in U.S. for various reasons
        - Winner-take-all elections
        - Specific movement history
    - Other strategies:
        - Disruption
        - Separatism/SelfSegregation
        - Ingroup empowerment
