# Change Essay

## Part 1

- Imagine you are at a barber shop or hair salon when you overhear a stylist debating with a client about whether
    - (a) people are inherently inclined to be prejudiced, or
    - (b) if it’s something people have to learn.
- The stylist believes that the answer is (a), people are inherently inclined to be prejudiced.
- The client (a parent) disagrees and is convinced they can raise their kids not to be prejudiced, though their confidence is shaken by the conversation. They look over to you, see that you’re studying social psychology, and hope you’ll have the answers.
- Based on material covered in class (i.e., lectures and readings), what insights or advice can you provide to this parent about what would be necessary to raise a child devoid of racial prejudice?
    - You are free to arrive at your own conclusions about whether it is possible or practical to accomplish this (i.e., you do not have to share the parent’s optimism).
    - Rather, convey what would have to occur (at least hypothetically) for a child to be raised without prejudice.

  

- In Part 1, focus on 3 of the most significant obstacles that might stand in the way of raising a person to not have racial prejudice.
    - Explain why you think these are the three most significant obstacles (compared to others)
    - Dutifully consider and explain what would be necessary to overcome the obstacles (rather than just dismissing them as impossible to overcome)
    - Share your assessment of the parent’s prospects for achieving their aim

  

## Part 2

- Now, imagine that Dr. Clark is a leader of a school system in the United States. Dr. Clark overheard what you had to say, was thoroughly impressed with what you said, and wanted to hear your thoughts about ways to reduce teachers’ prejudices.
- Dr. Clark ultimately cares about reducing racial disparities in student achievement and discipline so that Black students earn similar grades and experience similar levels of disciplinary actions as their White peers.
- What approach(es) would you suggest Dr. Clark take toward this objective? Explain why your approach is the superior choice compared to others Dr. Clark could take.

  

- In Part 2, choose up to two approaches (one is fine!) to reducing racial disparities from class to recommend.
    - For each, explain what they entail, how they could be implemented, and why they are superior to alternatives.
    - Here, define what you are trying to accomplish in the approaches you take and why your chosen approaches are better suited for meeting that objective than are other approaches.

  

## Logistics

# Guiding Questions

1. How is prejudiced expressed in an academic context?
2. How does the knowledge of prejudice affect stigmatized group members in academic settings?

  

## Roadmap

1. Educational Context
2. Perceiver Factors
    1. People who exhibit and perceive the prejudice.
    2. Perceivers will primarily be teachers.
3. Target Factors
    1. People who are the subjects of the prejudice
    2. Targets will primarily be students

![Untitled 190.png](attachments/Untitled%20190.png)

  

# Education Context

- Recall the MODE acronym from Prejudice!
    - Motivation and Opportunity are the Determinants of whether people will be prejudiced.
    - Opportunity usually refers to cognitive resources:
        - Are there enough cognitive resources to get them to overcome the prejudice?
    - Fewer cognitive resources = more stereotyping
        - E.g. An overwhelming amount of information, doing multiple tasks at once, fatigue

  

- Educational inequality can be seen in test scores!
    
    - Over time, the income gap in standardized test scores has been increasing.
    - Over time, the black-white gap in standardized test scores has been decreasing.
    
    ![Untitled 1 153.png](attachments/Untitled%201%20153.png)
    

  

- Inequality can also be seen in terms of degrees.
    
    - Men tend to go towards “male” fields of study much more than “female” fields.
    
    ![Untitled 2 152.png](attachments/Untitled%202%20152.png)
    

  

- Inequality is also seen in terms of disciplinary actions!
    
    - Black students get suspensions disproportionately more than white students.
    
    ![Untitled 3 149.png](attachments/Untitled%203%20149.png)
    
      
    
    - This inequality can be further expanded by region! For most of the US, black students have a higher risk of being suspended than white students.
    
    ![Untitled 4 144.png](attachments/Untitled%204%20144.png)
    

  

## Explaining Disparities

- How do we explain the presence of large, persistent identity-based disparities?
    - Focal Outcome Variables
        - Educational Attainment
        - Academic Achievement
        - Discipline
    - Focal Identity Dimensions
        - Race
        - Gender
        - Socioeconomic Status

  

- The underlying psychological processes contributing to these disparities are understood to be general. Who they affect is determined by the situation.

  

# Perceiver Factors

![Untitled 5 142.png](attachments/Untitled%205%20142.png)

  

  

## Teacher Perceptions Meta-Analysis (Tenenbaum & Ruck 2007)

- Meta-Analysis: a type of study that looks across all other literature to find out what the literature cumulatively currently know.

  

- **Method:**
    - Sought to quantitatively detect the presence and size of effects across a host of studies
- **Outcomes:**
    - Ratings of Students (39 samples)
    - Student Referrals (15 samples)
        - E.g. refer to disciplinary programs, etc
    - Treatment of Students(11 samples)

  

- **Findings:**
    
    - In terms of perceptions:
        - Teachers tended to view white students more positively than black and hispanic students.
    - In terms of referrals:
        - Teachers made more positive and fewer negative referrals for white students compared to black and hispanic students.
    - In terms of positive behaviors:
        - Teachers made more positive and neutral speech to white students than black and hispanic students.
    
      
    
    - This is strengthened by the Pygmalion Effect/Confirmation Bias!

  

## Teacher Bias (Yates & Marcelo, 2013)

- Racial bias within teachers emerges very early!

  

- They took **171 racially diverse preschoolers** (45-54 months old) and **93 teachers**
- Caregivers & preschoolers came into the lab to complete a pretend play task
    - An experimenter gave kids sets of toys, told them vignettes, and encouraged kids to make up stories to finish the vignettes with the toys they receive,
    - They rated the child’s
        - imagination in play
        - positive emotion
        - negative emotion

  

- 1-3 months after lab assessment, the children’s real teachers then completed a survey about the students
    - School Preparedness
    - Peer Acceptance
    - Teacher-Student Conflict

  

- In terms of imaginative play:
    
    - For black kids, the teacher thought that kids with more imaginative play were less prepared for school.
    - For white kids, the teacher thought that kids with more imaginative play were more prepared for school.
    
    ![Untitled 6 140.png](attachments/Untitled%206%20140.png)
    

  

  

## Teacher Bias & Disparate Outcomes

- Differential Treatment (in the Same School) is the Largest Driver of Racial Discipline Gaps
    
    - As seen, when there is differential treatment with the same behaviors, problem scores increase.
    
    ![Untitled 7 136.png](attachments/Untitled%207%20136.png)
    

  

### Okonofua & Eberhardt Study (2015)

- Teachers rated Black or White students after they misbehaved once, then twice in class on…
    - Feeling Troubled
    - Disciplinary Action

  

- Findings:
    - Based on the left, teachers feel more troubled by black student’s misbehavior.
    - Based on the right, teachers felt black students should be disciplined more.

![Untitled 8 127.png](attachments/Untitled%208%20127.png)

![Untitled 9 123.png](attachments/Untitled%209%20123.png)

  

- This is seen in the real world:
    
    - Black people have more suspensions than white.
    
    ![Untitled 10 118.png](attachments/Untitled%2010%20118.png)
    

  

## Brilliance Stereotype

- Men are more associated with brilliance
- When brilliance is emphasized
    
    - Women are less represented a given discipline
    - Women doubt themselves and expect doubt
    
    - Women’s abilities are doubted
    

  

### Storage et al. study (2016)

- Looked at how many times “genius” and “brilliant” was used on ratemyprofessor.com

![Untitled 11 114.png](attachments/Untitled%2011%20114.png)

  

![Untitled 12 111.png](attachments/Untitled%2012%20111.png)

  

## Neal et al. study (2003)

> [!important]  
> Stereotyping extends beyond being black to acting black  

- They had 136 middle school teachers.
- Teachers watched a video of a student walking.
    - IV: student rate
        - Black or white
    - IV: student walk
        - “standard” walk
        - “stroll” → hip hop walk, generally related to African Americans
    - DV: adjective checklist
        - Achievement
        - Adgression
    - DV: special education referral
        - How likely was teacher to refer them to special education?

  

- Findings: doing the “black stroll” affects how the teacher rates them.
    
    - Teachers rated students who strolled as lower achievement than standard walk.
    - They also thought those who strolled were more aggressive.
    - Same thing with special education referral, but only a bit less.
    - Interestingly, they thought the black students were higher achievement than white studies.
        - This was likely related to the teachers, knowing they were in a study, suppressing their own biases.
        - However, they were not able to suppress the bias regarding the walk, because they were not cognizant of that.
    
    ![Untitled 13 102.png](attachments/Untitled%2013%20102.png)
    

  

  

## Van den Bergh et al study (2010)

> [!important]  
> Implicit racial bias predicts teachers’ expectations & students’ outcomes  

- Sample
    - 41 Dutch teachers
- Measures
    - Teachers
        - Implicit Bias (IAT)
        - Individual student expectations
    - Students
        - Achievement

  

- Findings:
    
    - Expectations of dutch students were higher. Their corresponding achievement was also higher.
    
    ![Untitled 14 90.png](attachments/Untitled%2014%2090.png)
    

  

## Mechanisms

- Q: What are some mechanisms through which teachers’ bias can impact students?
    1. Through Direct Assessment
    2. Through Interactions with Students
- These mechanisms shapes educational inequality.

### How? Anxious Interactions

- Study by Jacoby-Senghor et al. study (2016)
- The implicit bias in the instructor led to greater instructor anxiety, which lowered lesson quality, which lowered learner test scores.
    - The instructor is scared of letting the bias leak out, etc.

![Untitled 15 86.png](attachments/Untitled%2015%2086.png)

  

### How? Teaching Goals

- Study by Kumar et al. (2015)
- 241 White teachers from diverse schools in the Midwest
- Predictors
    - Implicit bias: Arab-White IAT
    - Explicit academic stereotyping measures
        - Generally White students place a higher value on education than do other students
        - Generally, minority students are not as interested in school and schoolwork as White students

  

- Mediators
    - Promoting mutual respect in the classroom
        - The more teachers were biased, the less they felt like promoting mutual respect.
    - Responsibility for interethnic conflict
        - The more teachers were biased, the less they feel responsible for interethnic conflict.
    - Responsibility for culturally responsive teaching
        - The more teachers were biased, the less they felt responsible for culturally resopnsive teaching.

  

- Outcomes
    - Instructional Practices
        - Mastery-focused: Emphasizing learning, effort, & progress
        - Performance-focused: Endorsing social comparison behaviors
            - I display the work of high achievers
            - I take privileges away from low achievers

  

## Regional Bias

- Besides just teacheres, there is bias throughout the region itself.

![Untitled 16 80.png](attachments/Untitled%2016%2080.png)

  

# Target Factors

![Untitled 17 75.png](attachments/Untitled%2017%2075.png)

  

- How might Black children’s perception of anti-Black biases (e.g., regarding intelligence, goodness, etc.) affect how they behave and perform in schools?
    1. Stereotype Threat
    2. Race-Based Rejection Sensitivity (RBRS

  

## Stereotype Threat

- The apprehension experienced by members of group that their behavior might confirm a cultural stereotype in a particular domain
    - You worry that how you behave might confirm a stereotype.
- Individual does not have to believe the stereotype for it to shape performance

  

### Steele & Aronson study (1995)

- They had black and white participants.

  

- IV: Salience of racial stereotype about intelligence
    1. In the first study, they labeled the test.
        - Label the test as Diagnostic of ability (threat)
            - Black participants are worried “ugh, its an intelligence test, the stereotype is that I’m not intelligent”
        - Label the test as Non-diagnostic (control)
    2. In the second study, they primed the participants on race.
        - Asked them to indicate race (threat)
        - No race question (control)

  

- DV: test performance on a challenging verbal test

  

![Untitled 18 68.png](attachments/Untitled%2018%2068.png)

![Untitled 19 61.png](attachments/Untitled%2019%2061.png)

  

### General Phenomenom

- This stereotype threat is a general phenomenom, regardless of group!
    - Women & math
    - SES & academic achievement
    - White & Black men in athlete performance
        - e.g. black men are stereotyped as better athletes than white

  

### Aronson et al. study (1999)

- White male students
- IV: stereotype priming:
    - Primed poor math performance of Whites relative to Asians
    - No information
- DV: Performance on difficult math exam

  

![Untitled 20 58.png](attachments/Untitled%2020%2058.png)

  

### Why does stereotype threat happen?

- Anxiety
- Intrusive thoughts
- Reduced working memory for task

  

- Factors that exacerbate stereotype threat:
    - Task is difficult
    - Domain is important to the self
    - Identify with stereotyped group
    - Situational cues that increase salience of group membership (e.g., token status)

  

- Factors that reduce stereotype threat:
    - Identity safety – convey stereotype does not apply in this situation
    - Role models
    - Incremental (as opposed to fixed) theory of intelligence

  

## Race-Based Rejection Sensitivity

- Anxious expectations of rejection based on group membership
- Measured by questionnaire
    - E.g. “Imagine that you are in class one day, and the professor asks a particularly difficult question. A few people, including yourself, raise their hands to answer the question.”
        - “How concerned/anxious would you be that the professor might not choose you because of your race/ethnicity?”
        - “I would expect that the professor might not choose me because of my race/ethnicity.”

  

### Mendoza-Denton et al. study (2002)

- Black college freshman
- Measured race-based rejection sensitivity in initial session
- Completed questionnaires over 21 days toward the beginning of school
- Also got grades for first 5 semesters

  

- Finding: races that have low rejection-sensitivity increase in well-being over the study period.
    
    ![Untitled 21 52.png](attachments/Untitled%2021%2052.png)
    

  

- Finding: reaces that low rejection-sensitivity increase in positivity towards professors.
    
    ![Untitled 22 48.png](attachments/Untitled%2022%2048.png)
    

  

- Finding: races that have high rejection-sensitivity see decreases in GPA over time.
    
    ![Untitled 23 45.png](attachments/Untitled%2023%2045.png)
    

  

# Stereotype Confirmation

- Stereotype Confirmation works to entrench problem behaviors from teacher and student, creating a recursive, “vicious” cycle

  

![Untitled 24 41.png](attachments/Untitled%2024%2041.png)

  

# Interventions

- There are two strategies and 5 approaches to reduce inequality.
    - Note: you should use these approaches in Part 2 of the Change essay.

  

- Bias reduction
    1. Cognitive
    2. Interpersonal
    3. Normative

  

- Bias management
    1. Direct/procedural
    2. Wise interventions

  

- Teacher attitudes affect student outcomes
    
    ![Untitled 25 36.png](attachments/Untitled%2025%2036.png)
    

  

# 1. Reducing Bias

- To stop teacher teacher attitudes from affecting student outcomes, we **reduce these teacher perceptions**.
    
    ![Untitled 26 31.png](attachments/Untitled%2026%2031.png)
    

  

## Approach A: Cognitive Paths to Bias Reduction

- In other words, “reprogramming” teachers to reduce bias.

![Untitled 27 27.png](attachments/Untitled%2027%2027.png)

  

- There is implicit attitude change seen in this approach.
    - However, notice that over time (in time 2), the reduction goes back to normal.

![Untitled 28 25.png](attachments/Untitled%2028%2025.png)

  

### Cons of Cognitive Approaches

1. Social context remains, making effects of reduction short-lived
2. Difficult to implement in practice (recall “MODE”)
    1. Motivation and Opportunity are the Determinants of whether people will be prejudiced.

  

## Approach B: Interpersonal Paths to Bias Reduction

- This is more towards using **contact** and other people to reduce bias.

![Untitled 29 24.png](attachments/Untitled%2029%2024.png)

  

### Intergroup Contact Theory (Allport, 1954)

- There were 4 conditions
    - Contact sanctioned by authorities
    - Equal status between groups
    - Cooperation
    - Acquaintance Potential

  

- Most well-researched way of reducing prejudice
- 100s of studies on wide variety of groups

  

### Intergroup Contact Study (Pettigrew & Tropp Study, 2006)

- Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006 – did meta-analysis of studies to that point (515)
    - Important results = effect sizes (they use r)
    - Conventionally for r - .1 is small, .3 is medium, .5 is large

  

- Intergroup contact reduces prejudice
    - around -.2
- Better when Allport’s conditions met
    - Conditions met (-.28) vs. No effort to meet conditions (-.2)
- Better when are friends (-.25)
- Works even when there is no choice
    - No choice (.28), Full choice (.22)

  

- Works via increased knowledge, increased empathy and decreased anxiety (latter 2 stronger)
- Effect stronger on affect than cognition

  

### Shook & Fazio study (2008)

- White first year students
- Completed measures in Fall and Spring
- IV: Assigned White or Black roommate
- DV: relationship quality and implicit prejudice

  

- As seen below:
    - After intergroup contact in session 1, they exhibit more pro-[other race] in session 2.

![Untitled 30 24.png](attachments/Untitled%2030%2024.png)

![Untitled 31 20.png](attachments/Untitled%2031%2020.png)

  

### Maziotti et al. study (2011)

> [!important]  
> Even just imagining contact may work!  

- German college students
- IV: Imagined self in video of German and Chinese student getting along (or control)
- DV: Evaluations of Chinese people

![Untitled 32 20.png](attachments/Untitled%2032%2020.png)

  

### Cons of Contact

- Can be easy to avoid, even in diverse contexts
- Increases minorities’ exposure to prejudice
- Can assuage appetite for structural change

  

## Approach C: Normative Paths to Bias Reduction

- This is using media, peers, etc → normative influence.

![Untitled 33 19.png](attachments/Untitled%2033%2019.png)

  

### Munger study (2017)

- Designed bots that confront White men using racist slurs on Twitter
    - E.g. @[subject] Hey man, just remember there are real people who are hurt when you harass them with that kind of language
- IV: They manipulated
    - Followers of bots (High vs. Low Popularity)
    - Race of bots (Ingroup vs. Outgroup)
- Measured subsequent slur usage of user

  

- As seen below:
    - Getting messages from in-group and high popularity users reduced slur usage the most.

![Untitled 34 15.png](attachments/Untitled%2034%2015.png)

  

### Norms via Environmental Cues (Cheryan et al. 2011)

  

- They showed participants two different environments.

![Untitled 35 13.png](attachments/Untitled%2035%2013.png)

  

- They found that in the non-stereotypical classroom, women were more likely to enroll, anticipate success, and feel ambient belonging.

![Untitled 36 12.png](attachments/Untitled%2036%2012.png)

  

### Cons of Norms

- Rebound
    - Prejudice gets released even more after people feel external pressure to suppress their prejudices
- Backlash
    - People perceive “reverse racisms” and resist
- Credentialing
    - People credit themselves with being a good person by complying with norms, then act badly
- Inaccurate perceptions of equity and progress
    - Conflating “we all agree we aren’t supposed to be racist” with “we all aren’t racist”

  

# 2. Mitigating Bias

- This means breaking the links between teachers’ prejudices and students’ outcomes

![Untitled 37 12.png](attachments/Untitled%2037%2012.png)

  

## Approach D

> [!important]  
> Directly or Procedurally Block Teachers Biases from Affecting Students  

- Examples
    - Blind grading procedures (students’ identities unknown)
- Pros
    - Can be effective when possible to implement
- Cons
    - Narrow applicability, hard to implement

  

## Approach E: Wise Interventions

> [!important]  
> “Wise” interventions → try to intervene on people’s construals (the way a person understands the world) about the world at critical times.  

- Strategy: help people develop adaptive construals at key times
    - Adaptive ways to think about the world at key times.
- Psychologically “wise” interventions focus on how people make sense of or interpret themselves, other people, or a social situation (i.e., their subjective construal)
- People’s answers to psychological questions are like their working hypotheses about the world that drives their behavior

  

- Examples
    - When a student receives critical academic feedback, does he worry that his teacher may have judged him as unintelligent?
    - When a new college student feels lonely or isolated on campus, does she wonder, “Can people like me belong here?”

  

- Wise interventions help teachers and students provide answers to these questions in ways that bolster students’ outcome

  

### Wise Feedback (Walton & Wilson, 2018)

- This is one example of a Wise intervention.
- Suppose you are writing an essay, and when you get it back, you see that your teacher wrote a bunch of comments on it.
    - This can be viewed as
        1. very threatening (the teaching thinks badly of me, very critical of me)
        2. very helpful (they believe in me so they are investing the time to write feedback to help me)

  

- What does this critical feedback communicate?
    - …if you’re a White student?
    - …if you’re a Black student?

  

- Wise feedback: frame the comments as indicative of teacher having high standards and confidence that you can meet them
    - Via teacher note
    - Via testimony of an older student that had that teacher

  

- When teachers give the student Wise feedback (e.g. high standards, assurance), the score on the revised essay is higher.

![Untitled 38 12.png](attachments/Untitled%2038%2012.png)

  
  

### Belonging & Performance (Walton & Cohen, 2011)

- Did belonging intervention in the second semester first year
    - Read that previous students overcame initial lack of belonging
    - Did a speech for future students saying this was the case for themselves
- White & Black students
- Tracked GPA over time

  

- They found that when students get social-belonging treatment…
    - their GPA increases and stays higher over the four years.
    - this effect is especially clear in African American students

![Untitled 39 11.png](attachments/Untitled%2039%2011.png)

  

### Yaeger at al study (2016)

![Untitled 40 11.png](attachments/Untitled%2040%2011.png)

  

### Note about Wise interventions

- These interventions include belonging, self-affirmation, mindset, etc.
- Effects are thought to occur via recursive processes
- Effects depend on the context
    - E.g., Weaker mindset effects when peers or teachers contradict the message

  

### Cons of Wise Interventions

- The goal of a wise intervention is not to reduce bias.
    - Therefore, **biases remain intact**
- Some question whether the availability of low cost, scalable solutions that mitigate inequalities forestalls structural change
    - Are these interventions scalable and tractable in terms of cost?
