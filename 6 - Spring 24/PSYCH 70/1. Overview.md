# Self-Serving Cognitive Biases

## **Motivated Reasoning**

- Tendency to come to conclusions that make you feel good.
- **Examples:**
    - People’s reluctance to admit they’re wrong
    - Reluctance to admit plausible flaws in our heroes, political candidates, family members, hometown, etc.
    - The incredible difficulty of ever really winning an argument.

### **Motivated handling/recall of evidence**

- People tend to attach more significant to facts that cut their way, argue these facts are more important, valid

### **Motivated group affiliation**

- Fair-weather fans → affiliate with a group after they are successful.
- After a group wins, fans usually say “we” → we won, etc
- After a group loses, fans usually refer to the team as “they” → they lost, etc

## Above-Average Effect

- Tendency of people to believe they are above average in valued domains
    - People tend to think they are more popular, more attractive, better drivers, etc
- **Below-average effect**
    - People tend to think they are worst are juggling, less likely to live to 100, etc

## Holier-Than-Thou Effect

- The same as the above-average effect, but applied in moral domains
- Relative to others, people believe that they are:
    - More equitable in distribution of funds
    - More likely to give to charity
    - More likely to cooperate in the “prisoner’s dilemma
- Predictions for others were **accurate**, while predictions for self were **inflated.**

- Unskilled and Unaware of it
    - Those with lower skills in a domain tend to exhibit greater above-average effect in that domain.
    - Cognitive and metacognitive skills tend to be correlated.
