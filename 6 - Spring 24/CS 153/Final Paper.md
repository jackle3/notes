# Background

In the past year, generative AI and large language models has become an integral component in how people interact with the world around them, and has helped facilitate thousands of startups and products that harness their power for downstream tasks.

One of the most interesting applications of LLMs and generative AI is in the software supply chain, specifically with both preventing and empowering supply chain attacks. In this section, we provide a background on both LLMs and the software supply chain.

## Part 1
* Explanation of **emerging technology**; how does it work, what can it do, and what **stage of emergence/prevalence** is it at?

Generative artificial intelligence is AI that is capable of generating text, images, video, audio, and more using generative models, often in response to prompts. Some state of the art models include OpenAI's GPT and Sora, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, and Anthropic's Claude.

Language models are a subset of generative AI designed to understand, comprehend, and generate text. LLMs are trained on an extremely large corpus of data, and has been shown to be on-par with or even above human capability on a wide of range of tasks across many domains, including translation, sentiment analysis, and coding. From a high-level overview, LLMs work by reading and processing text from a context window, and using that to predict the next word in a sequence.

Generative AI can perform a variety of tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, video and image generation, image interpretation, and more. They can also be used to write and understand code, and can be paired with other systems to allow execution of code and more. They can also be used to detect anomalies, crosschecking the code that they see against the vast data that they have been trained against. 

As of now, language models are widely used in various industries. They are prevalent in applications such as customer service, content creation, and data analysis. The technology is continually advancing, with newer models being developed that offer improved accuracy, efficiency, and capabilities.

Generative AI is rapidly evolving and becoming more prevalent across various sectors. It is widely used in entertainment, marketing, and content creation industries. The technology has reached a stage where it can produce highly realistic and convincing outputs, making it a powerful tool for both beneficial and malicious purposes. The continuous improvements in computational power and algorithms are driving the widespread adoption and further development of generative AI technologies.

## Part 2
* Explanation of the **threat model** of the security topic; provide real-world example(s) of **previous attack(s)** to justify why this is an important and relevant security topic.


**Supply Chain Attacks:** Supply chain attacks involve compromising an organization through vulnerabilities in its supply chain. This can include inserting malicious code into software updates, tampering with hardware components, or exploiting third-party services. These attacks exploit the trust relationships between an organization and its suppliers, partners, or service providers. 

Supply chain attacks are particularly dangerous because they can affect multiple organizations simultaneously, given the interconnected nature of modern supply chains. These attacks can lead to significant data breaches, operational disruptions, and financial losses. As organizations increasingly rely on third-party vendors and services, the risk and potential impact of supply chain attacks have grown substantially.

Real-world examples include the SolarWinds attack, where malicious code was inserted into a software update, and the Target breach, where attackers gained access through a third-party HVAC contractor. These attacks highlight the vulnerabilities in supply chains and the significant impact they can have on organizations, making supply chain security a critical issue.

Another particularly notable supply chain attack was the `xz utils` backdoor. This was an intricate combination of both social engineering and supply chain attack.

Supply chain attacks are increasingly prevalent and sophisticated, as demonstrated by the examples above. The interconnectedness of modern supply chains and the widespread reliance on third-party vendors create numerous entry points for attackers. The significant impact of these attacks on organizations' operations, finances, and reputations underscores the importance of improving supply chain security.

# abstract
This paper examines the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and supply chain security, exploring both the opportunities and vulnerabilities introduced by this emerging technology. We explore how these models can strengthen defensive strategies in the supply chain, as well as how they can be weaponized to launch more advanced and frequent supply chain attacks. We also outline specific mitigation strategies for the risks created by LLMs, such as deploying proactive defenses and enhancing support for open-source software. By leveraging LLMs effectively and addressing their associated risks, organizations can enhance their supply chain security and build more resilient systems against an evolving landscape of cyber threats.


This paper examines the impact of large language models (LLMs) on supply chain security, identifying their potential to both strengthen defenses and introduce new vulnerabilities. Through analysis of recent supply chain attacks, we demonstrate the dual nature of LLMs: while they can automate threat detection and enhance cybersecurity measures, they also present novel opportunities for attackers, such as automating social engineering and vulnerability discovery. We propose mitigation strategies that leverage LLMs for protective measures and emphasize strengthening open-source software frameworks to safeguard the supply chain. We claim that with careful implementation, LLMs can play a crucial role in enhancing the resilience of supply chain security against emerging cyber threats.

# security topic
Supply chain attacks represent a critical security challenge that capitalizes on vulnerabilities within an organization’s supply chain, exploiting the inherent trust between a company and its suppliers or service providers. This attack leverages the interconnectedness of modern software supply chains, where a single compromise can ripple through numerous entities linked by dependencies. By targeting less-secure elements within the supply network, such as third-party software components, attackers can gain unauthorized access to secure systems and sensitive information of multiple organizations.

A recent example of a supply chain attack is the xz utils backdoor, where attackers introduced a backdoor into a dependency of ssh that granted them remote code execution capabilities. Over a period of two years, attackers conducted a sophisticated social engineering campaign to gain the trust of the package's sole maintainer, eventually taking control of the project. Other notable incidents include the SolarWinds attack, where malicious code was inserted into a trusted software update, affecting thousands of businesses and government agencies, and the Target breach, which involved attackers gaining access through a third-party HVAC contractor, leading to the exposure of personal information of millions of customers. These incidents highlight the need for robust defenses and monitoring of all components within the supply chain.

As organizations and products increasingly rely on suppliers and third-party services, the integrity and security of the software supply chain has become a more crucial and relevant topic in security than ever before. 

# emerging tech

Large language models and generative AI represent a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, providing a powerful toolset for a variety of applications across different sectors, including cybersecurity. LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude, work by processing vast datasets to learn complex patterns in text, images, videos, and more. These models generate content by predicting the next piece of data -- be it a word, pixel, or audio wave -- based on the patterns they have learned and the prompts they are given. This capability enables them to perform tasks such as text generation, language translation, content moderation, and even code generation and analysis.

Though LLMs are a relatively novel technology, their stage of emergence and prevalence is rapidly advancing. They have integrated into everyday technology, and has reached a stage where they can influence how people interact with the world around them, through applications such as chatbots and virtual assistants. Not only that, LLMs are also being used by businesses for commercial applications. For example, Intuit and many other companies have recently launched conversational agents powered by LLMs that are capable of handling a wide range of customer queries, ranging from customer support to even financial advice [ VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-enterprises-are-using-open-source-llms-16-examples/|(Marshall, 2024)](Marshall,%202024))). 

The ability of these models to analyze and interpret large amounts of data makes them particularly valuable for cybersecurity applications. They can identify patterns indicative of malicious activity and help automate responses to security threats, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of cybersecurity measures. As the technology continues to develop, its adoption is becoming more prevalent, with ongoing research pushing the boundaries of what these AI models can achieve. The introduction of LLMs has prompted a shift towards more autonomous systems capable of complex decision-making and problem-solving across a large variety of sectors.


# risk analysis

The integration of generative AI into supply chain security leads to various complex interactions. Although GenAI can certainly enhance the defensive capabilities of the supply chain, they can also be used my malicious actors to create novel threat vectors, which introduces significant risks.

On the offensive front, LLMs can be leveraged to generate and spoof vendor communications, creating highly realistic but fraudulent emails, invoices, or software updates that can deceive employees into compromising their organization's security. Given that software supply chains can be extensive, the chances of a dependency being breached by social engineering is quite high. A study by [Julian Hazell of Oxford]([1%20(governance.ai)](https://cdn.governance.ai/Spear_Phishing_with_Large_Language_Models.pdf)) found that LLMs are highly effective at writing personalized emails for spear-phishing, and that setting up mass AI-powered spear-phishing campaigns can be achieved in as little as a few hours by malicious actors with limited technical expertise. From this study, the threat of LLMs being used for social engineering is clear -- if combined with supply chain attacks, LLMs can create the risk of breaches being initiated through seemingly trustworthy communications, which can cascade through the supply chain and create devastating effects.

Furthermore, LLMs' ability to process large amounts of information automatically makes them valuable tools for attackers seeking to automate the scouting of vulnerabilities across a supply chain network. This is particularly relevant in the context of open-source software, where LLMs can review source code to identify weak points such as outdated software or insecure API usage, which can then be exploited to launch targeted attacks. In addition, recent advancements have made LLMs very good at code generation, meaning that attackers can theoretically create an AI-powered pipeline that both finds vulnerabilities in the supply chain and generates code to launch targeted exploits against those vulnerabilities, which creates significant risks for software supply chain security.

Conversely, LLMs can also provide significant defensive capabilities against supply chain attacks. Using the previously mentioned ability to process large amounts of information, LLMs can continuously monitor and analyze patterns within the supply chain to identify anomalies that may indicate a security threat or ongoing attack. This can be critical for the early detection and prevention breaches before they escalate into more severe incidents, mitigating the risk of potentially missing signals in human-powered auditing systems. In addition, LLMs can be used to analyze historical data to forecast potential disruptions or pinpoint emerging threats, allowing organizations to proactively address vulnerabilities. A real-world example of these defensive strategies is demonstrated by companies like like Socket, which leverages the power of LLMs to stay ahead of ["the constant onslaught of malicious packages published to public registries"]([The%20AI%20Advantage:%20Reshaping%20Cybersecurity%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Autonomous%20Threats%20-%20Socket), allowing them to provide early warnings on potential supply chain attacks.

By leveraging for LLMs for anomaly detection and historical analysis, such as by using Socket's product, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of supply chain attacks by identifying and addressing dependency vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

The integration of GenAI into supply chain security can introduce both opportunities for enhancing security as well as potential for new vulnerabilities and threat vectors. This section explores the interplay between this emerging technology and the inherent risks within the supply chain.

Starting with offensive interactions, GenAI's ability to produce convincing, human-like content can be misused for malicious purposes. For instance, the text generation capabilities of LLMs can be used in phishing campaigns, where attackers craft highly personalized and context-aware messages that can bypass conventional security training. 

A real-world example of this is the use of AI-generated phishing emails that mimic legitimate corporate communications, making them particularly effective in deceiving employees. This scenario highlights the risk of AI in enhancing social engineering attacks within the supply chain.

Moreover, the generative capabilities extend beyond text to include images and videos. Deepfakes—synthetically generated media that can swap faces or mimic voices—are a burgeoning threat. Although primarily noted in misinformation campaigns, their potential use in supply chain attacks is a significant concern. For instance, attackers could create fake video messages from executives to issue fraudulent orders or leak manipulated confidential meetings to manipulate stock prices or sabotage business strategies.

**Defensive Interactions:** On the defense side, LLMs and generative AI offer powerful tools for identifying and mitigating risks within supply chains. One of the most impactful applications is anomaly detection, where AI models analyze communication patterns and transaction data to spot deviations that could indicate a breach or an ongoing attack. For example, AI systems are currently deployed in financial sectors to detect fraudulent transaction patterns—a capability that is equally valuable in monitoring supply chain activities for signs of compromise.

Predictive analytics is another area where AI excels, utilizing historical data to forecast potential vulnerabilities or attacks before they occur. AI-driven predictive models are used in cybersecurity to anticipate threat vectors based on emerging trends, which can be adapted for predictive supply chain security to preemptively tighten defenses or scrutinize particular areas or vendors based on predicted risk levels.

**Real-world Example of Defensive AI:** A notable instance of defensive AI application is the use of machine learning models by the company Socket, which is at the forefront of AI-powered threat detection for supply chain attacks. Socket harnesses LLMs to provide early warnings on more than 100 attacks per week, demonstrating the proactive potential of AI in defense. Leveraging AI in this way is crucial for staying ahead of the constant onslaught of malicious packages published to public registries, particularly as many threat actors have yet to enhance their operations with AI-driven capabilities. Furthermore, AI-driven security systems can orchestrate rapid response strategies, automatically deploying countermeasures or patches when a potential threat is detected, thus minimizing impact.

**Risks Created and Mitigated:** While the applications of LLMs and generative AI in supply chain security are promising, they also introduce new risks. The complexity and opacity of AI models, referred to as "black box" algorithms, can lead to scenarios where errors or biases in the AI's decision-making process are not easily detectable until after a security breach occurs. Moreover, the data used to train these models, if compromised, can lead to manipulated AI behaviors that favor attackers.

However, when properly managed and secured, the benefits offered by AI, such as enhanced detection capabilities and strategic predictive analyses, can outweigh the risks. These technologies enable organizations to not only respond to threats more swiftly but also to anticipate and neutralize them before they can cause harm, thereby significantly enhancing the resilience and security of supply chains.

In conclusion, the dual-use nature of LLMs and generative AI in supply chain security underscores the need for careful, strategic implementation accompanied by rigorous security measures. By understanding and mitigating the associated risks, these technologies can be harnessed to significantly strengthen supply chain defenses.


# mitigation

### 3. MITIGATION OF RISKS

Addressing the risks associated with the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in supply chain security requires a multifaceted approach. This section details specific, actionable mitigation strategies that can protect against the vulnerabilities identified in the previous section.

**Mitigation for Enhanced Social Engineering:**

The risk of LLMs being used to create sophisticated social engineering attacks, such as phishing, is particularly alarming due to their potential scale and believability. To counteract this, one effective strategy involves the implementation of advanced AI-driven email filtering systems. These systems can be integrated into organizational email servers to scrutinize incoming communications for signs of phishing or other social engineering tactics. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, these filters can analyze email content for anomalies that deviate from typical communication patterns within the organization. Additionally, ongoing training of these models with new and emerging phishing techniques is essential to maintain their effectiveness.

A critical aspect of implementing such systems is their ability to learn and adapt. For instance, incorporating feedback mechanisms where employees can flag missed phishing attempts helps refine the model’s accuracy. This continuous learning approach ensures the system evolves in response to the ever-changing tactics used by attackers.

Furthermore, pairing AI-driven email filtering with comprehensive user training and awareness programs enhances the overall defense strategy. These programs should educate employees about the characteristics of phishing emails and the importance of scrutinizing unsolicited links or attachments. Interactive training sessions, including simulated phishing exercises, can be particularly effective. These simulations should be tailored to reflect the specific nature of attacks that employees might face, using examples generated by AI to mirror the sophistication of potential real-life attacks.

**Mitigation for Automation of Threats:**

The potential for attackers to use LLMs to automate the generation of malicious code or to exploit vulnerabilities requires a robust defense strategy focusing on code integrity and security. Implementing automated code review tools within the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline offers a proactive measure to detect malicious insertions or vulnerabilities in real-time. These tools can use static analysis powered by AI to compare new code submissions against a database of known security issues and anomalous code patterns.

For instance, before any code is deployed into production, it can be automatically scanned by these tools. Anomalies or potential vulnerabilities flagged by the tool can then be manually reviewed by security experts to determine if they pose a genuine threat. Integrating such tools directly into the development environment not only minimizes disruptions in the workflow but also ensures that security is a continuous priority throughout the software development lifecycle.

In addition to automated code reviews, establishing a standardized protocol for third-party code audits is crucial, especially for software components coming from external suppliers. These audits can be conducted periodically to ensure compliance with security standards and to identify any new vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Collaboration with supply chain partners to establish and maintain these standards is essential, creating a unified front against potential security threats.

**General Mitigation Practices:**

Across all mitigation efforts, a layered security approach combining technological solutions with human oversight is critical. While LLMs and other AI technologies offer powerful tools for automating and enhancing security processes, they should not replace the critical thinking and decision-making capabilities of human security professionals. Instead, these technologies should be viewed as augmentative tools that enhance the capabilities of security teams, allowing them to respond more effectively and efficiently to potential threats.

Ultimately, the successful mitigation of risks associated with LLMs in supply chain security hinges on the strategic integration of advanced technologies, comprehensive training programs, and robust procedural safeguards. This holistic approach ensures that while organizations can harness the benefits of LLMs, they also remain vigilant and prepared against the sophisticated threats these technologies could inadvertently enable.

## another draft


The interaction between large language models and the software supply chain can introduce significant vulnerabilities, such as facilitating advanced social engineering attacks and enabling attackers to automatically identify and exploit weaknesses within software dependencies. In this section, we will discuss the potential strategies for mitigating and defending against these risks, as well as the level at which the risks should be mitigated, with the goal of safeguarding against the misuse of LLMs while still maintaining our ability to leverage their strengths for supply chain security.

The first strategy to counteract offensive uses of LLMs, such as automated vulnerability scouting, is to employ those very LLMs defensively within the supply chain. As mentioned in the previous section, organizations can detect anomalies and potential attack vectors proactively by utilizing LLMs to continuously monitor the software supply chain. For instance, organizations can use LLMs to analyze code changes in dependencies, ensuring that any changes changes are reviewed before they can be deployed. This automated checking using LLMs would provide early warnings about potential supply chain vulnerabilities, stopping the attack before it can happen. This is a particularly suitable task for LLMs since it would be intractable for humans to manually review the changes of every single dependency of their application, especially in web products where there can be thousands of dependencies. Furthermore, companies might consider involving third-party providers or in-house security teams to manually review significant changes. This combination of automated and manual review processes serves as a robust defense mechanism against the introduction of malicious code or unintentional security flaws into the supply chain. These mitigation strategies should be deployed at the company-level in order to ensure that the third-party software used by every team is secure.


Another strategy to mitigate the risks introduced by LLMs in supply chain security is to increase support for open-source software. Open-source software, which makes up a significant portion of the software supply chain, is particularly vulnerable since many projects have limited resources and oversight. In addition, since open-source software is publicly available for all, attackers can use LLMs to automatically scan the codebases for potential vulnerabilities. To enhance the security and sustainability of open-source projects, governments and companies can provide financial support, help increase maintainership, and encourage contributions to the open-source community. Such support not only strengthens the project but also builds a more resilient supply chain by increasing the overall security standards of open-source dependencies, preventing scenarios like the XZ Utils attack from happening.

Finally, to combat the risk of social engineering, which LLMs can exacerbate by generating convincing fake communications, companies should invest in employee training programs to build a more security-oriented company culture. Training should focus on recognizing signs of phishing and understanding the security protocols surrounding third-party dependencies. In addition, companies can create secure communication channels between dependencies and the companies that use them, which reduces the risk of 

enhancing communication channels between dependencies and the companies that use them with secure, verified methods can also reduce the risk of deceptive practices succeeding. This might include encrypted communication channels, the use of digital signatures, or established verification processes that confirm the legitimacy of communications regarding updates or changes in supply chain components.

By implementing these focused strategies, organizations can leverage the power of LLMs to enhance their supply chain security while effectively mitigating the associated risks. This balanced approach ensures that advancements in AI contribute positively to supply chain integrity and resilience against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.


---

The interaction between large language models and the software supply chain introduces significant vulnerabilities, including facilitating advanced social engineering attacks and enabling automated identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities within software dependencies. This section discusses potential strategies for mitigating these risks, with a focus on leveraging LLMs for defense, and addresses the levels at which these risks should be mitigated to safeguard the supply chain effectively.

To counteract the offensive capabilities of LLMs, companies can employ those very LLMs to defend themselves against supply chain attacks. For example, companies can use LLMs to continuously monitor the software supply chain, analyzing published changes in dependencies to proactively detect anomalies and potential attack vectors. By setting up systems that automatically review changes, organizations can prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited before they impact the system. This approach benefits from the scalability of LLMs since it would be intractable for humans to manually audit every change in an application's dependencies, especially in production environments where there can be thousands of software dependencies. A real-world example of this strategy in action is the aforementioned company, Socket, which combines static analysis, LLMs, and human auditors to detect and block anomalies in third-party packages in real-time.

Another crucial strategy is increasing support from the industry for open-source software, which often forms the backbone of the software supply chain. Open-source software is a highly vulnerable part of the supply chain because not only do they often have limited resources and oversight, attackers can also LLMs to scan public repositories for exploitable flaws. Therefore, enhancing the resilience of these projects is crucial. Governments and larger corporations can play a pivotal role by providing financial support, increasing maintainership, and fostering active contributions to the open-source community. For instance, initiatives like the Open Source Security Foundation offer frameworks and financial resources that help maintain and secure open-source projects. Such initiatives increase the overall security standards of open-source dependencies and prevent incidents such as the XZ Utils attack, thereby strengthening the entire supply chain.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, organizations can harness the benefits of LLMs for enhancing supply chain security while effectively addressing the vulnerabilities these technologies may introduce. This not only mitigates potential threats but also fortifies the resilience of the software supply chain against an evolving landscape of cyber threats.
