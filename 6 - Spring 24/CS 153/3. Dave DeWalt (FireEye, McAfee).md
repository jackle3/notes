# David DeWalt's Talk on Cybersecurity

## Introduction to Cybersecurity Concepts

- **Endpoint-based Security:** Protection strategies that focus on securing individual devices (endpoints) that connect to a network.
- **Blacklisting vs. Whitelisting:**
    - **Blacklisting:** Method of security where known threats are blocked from accessing a system.
    - **Whitelisting:** Only pre-approved applications or activities are allowed, enhancing security by preventing unknown applications from executing.

## Terminology

- **Zero-Day Exploit:** A previously unknown software vulnerability that hackers can exploit before developers become aware of it and patch it.
- **Phishing:** A method of stealing sensitive information (like login credentials) by tricking users into revealing personal information, often through fake emails or websites.
- **Ransomware and Wiper Attacks:** Types of malware designed to extort money from victims or destroy data, respectively.

## Historical Context of Viruses and Malware

- **Early 2000s Threats:**
    - **I Love You Virus and Worms:** Examples of malicious software that spread rapidly and caused significant damage globally. Worms are self-replicating malware that spread without user interaction, differing from viruses that require the execution of an infected host file.

## Evolution of Cyber Threats (2006-2008)

- **2006-2007:** Increase in the diversity and number of viruses.
- **2008 Epiphany:** Marked by the sophistication of viruses turning into what is known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
- **Operation Aurora (2009):**
    - **Background:** A landmark cyber espionage campaign believed to be orchestrated by Chinese state-sponsored hackers.
    - **Target:** Intellectual property theft from American technology companies as part of Chinaâ€™s technological advancement strategy under the Belt and Road Initiative.
    - **Impact:** Led to significant breaches including Google, with repercussions including Google's reconsideration of its operations in China.

## Significant Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

- **Night Dragon:** Cyberattacks targeting the global oil and gas industry, aimed at obtaining sensitive information to advantage Chinese companies in global bidding processes.
- **Shady Rat:** Another significant cyber espionage effort that targeted government entities, corporations, and international organizations over several years.

## Cybersecurity in the Global Political Arena

- **International Collaboration:**
    - **Five Eyes Alliance:** An intelligence alliance involving Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, sharing cybersecurity intelligence and strategies.
    - **Less Collaboration with Adversarial Nations:** Notably Russia and China, where collaboration is minimal to none.

## The Role of FireEye and Mandiant

- **FireEye:** Known for its expertise in responding to complex cyber threats and advanced threat detection technologies.
- **Mandiant:** Acquired by FireEye, renowned for its incident response services and handling some of the most high-profile cybersecurity breaches.
    - Mandiant was later acquired by Google.

## Future of Cybersecurity

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning:** Tools that are increasingly vital in cybersecurity for predictive threat detection and automated response mechanisms.
- **Emerging Threats and Defense Mechanisms:**
    - **Deep Fakes and Misinformation:** Identified as one of the largest emerging threats, capable of influencing public opinion and political events.
    - **Quantum Computing:** Poised to both pose new threats and enhance security, particularly in encryption and secure communications.

## Closing Thoughts

- **Importance of Cybersecurity Awareness:** Understanding the evolving landscape of cybersecurity is essential for protecting national interests, corporate assets, and personal information.
- **Career Opportunities:** The cybersecurity field is rapidly expanding, offering numerous opportunities for professionals interested in defending against cyber threats.
