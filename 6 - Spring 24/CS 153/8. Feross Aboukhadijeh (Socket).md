## About
* CEO of Socket, one of the fastest growing startups in security
* Focuses on security at scale in the open source world
* Class of 2012 at Stanford, came back for masters in 2018
  * Basically just wrote open source software full-time during that gap

* Started out in open source
  * Board member of Node.js Foundation

* Moved into security
  * Created and taught web security at Stanford University

* Now scaling open source security for many orgs
  * Founder and CEO at Socket, delivering a product that defends applications from software supply chain attacks

## Open Source
* Applications are built on thousands of open source dependencies
  * Open source software is a large part of the software supply chain.
  * E.g. `express` depends on thousands of dependencies
* The average package has 79 transitive dependencies.
  * Each of these dependencies are open source with a Github repo and a team (or one person) working on them.

### Attacks on OSS
* Since so many products depend on OSS dependencies, attackers can add malicious code into an OSS product
* This is a supply chain attack because it affects all the products depending on it.

### Dependency Confusion Attack
* Companies usually have internal private packages on `npm`
* If an attacker can find the the name of the private package, they can register that name on the public registry of `npm`.
* If the company’s security is bad, 

## `xz` Utils backdoor
* The `xz` utils package was maintained by one person, and it’s used widely in Linux for compression and many other things.
	  * Basically all Linux servers depend on this code.
* Over a period of two years, a group (likely backed by China) did **social engineering** to get the trust of the sole maintainer to get control over the package.
	* They pressured the maintainer over the years to eventually get them to transfer maintainer-ship to the attacker.
	* This was elaborate social engineering, using multiple accounts to influence and gain the maintainer's trust.
* The attacker introduced a backdoor into `xz` to compromise `ssh` servers.
	* Servers have an `ssh` process called the `ssh-daemon`.
	* Any time you type `ssh`, this daemon is what responds to it.
	* This daemon depends on this `xz` utils library, among other things.
	* The attackers found that `xz` utils was the most vulnerable because it was only maintained by one guy.


### Key Details from Feross Aboukhadijeh's Talk

#### Introduction
- **Speaker**: Feross Aboukhadijeh, CEO of Socket, a startup focused on making open source safer.
- **Background**: Stanford class of 2012, returned for a master's in 2018.
- **Experience**: Wrote open source software full-time during the gap, involved in Node.js Foundation governance.

#### Open Source Software
- **Prevalence**: Modern applications are often composed of 95% open source code.
- **Dependencies**: Applications depend heavily on multiple layers of dependencies (e.g., a single dependency like Express can pull in many transitive dependencies).
- **Security Implications**: Security of an application depends not only on its own code but also on the security of all its dependencies.

#### Supply Chain Attacks
- **Example - XZUtils Attack**:
  - **Dependency**: XZUtils, a widely used data compression project in Linux, maintained by one person.
  - **Attack**: Likely state-sponsored (potentially by China), attackers built trust with the maintainer over two years, introduced a backdoor.
  - **Detection**: Accidentally discovered due to a 500ms delay in SSH, traced back to the compromised dependency.

#### Notable Points on Open Source and Security
- **Dependency Confusion Attack**:
  - **Mechanism**: Attackers use names of private packages, register them publicly to trick internal tooling.
  - **Example**: Package named after a likely internal Airbnb package to exploit this confusion.

- **SolarWinds Hack**:
  - **Type**: Similar supply chain attack where code in a supplier's software was compromised.
  - **Impact**: Affected many downstream users due to the compromised supplier's code being integrated into their systems.

#### Burnout in Open Source
- **Single Maintainer Issue**: Many critical projects are maintained by one individual, leading to burnout and potential security risks.
- **Community Dynamics**: Shift from large projects with many contributors to many small projects maintained by individuals.

#### Addressing Open Source Security
- **Static Analysis and AI**:
  - **Tools**: Use of static analysis and AI to detect malicious code patterns in dependencies.
  - **Example**: Socket detects and flags suspicious behaviors like stealing environment variables or opening network connections.

- **Importance of SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**:
  - **Requirement**: Federal government now mandates SBOMs for software it purchases.
  - **Benefit**: Increases visibility into the dependencies and components used in software.

#### Recommendations for Open Source Contributors
- **Maintaining Projects**:
  - **Best Practices**: Regularly review contributions, establish trust with contributors, possibly through more personal interactions like video calls.
  - **Handling Negativity**: Avoid negative comments that demotivate maintainers; offer constructive help instead.

#### Personal Insights
- **Gap Year Advice**: Taking time off for industry experience can provide a valuable perspective when returning to academic studies.
- **Engagement with Professors**: Leveraging relationships with professors can lead to unique opportunities, such as teaching a course.

#### Feross' Experience with Socket
- **Detection**: Example of real-time malware detection in packages using static analysis and AI.
- **Case Study**: Wells Fargo/SDK UI package flagged for collecting and exfiltrating sensitive data.

#### Closing Thoughts
- **Community Involvement**: Importance of engaging with the open source community and maintaining healthy project practices.
- **Continuous Vigilance**: Security is an ongoing effort, with the need for better tools and practices to keep open source safe.
