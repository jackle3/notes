# 1 Trends In AI
The resurgency of AI has been sparked by:
1. Data from web
2. Compute \(cloud, GPUs\)
3. Algorithms
## 1.1 Trend 1: Don't Code, Learn
**Most AI in the 80s were hand\-coded**

\[ data input \] → \[ hand\-coded rules\]  → \[ "intelligence" \]
\[ english sentence \] —&gt; \[ dictionary and grammar rules \] —&gt; \[spanish sentence\]

**An AI system is simply a system that exhibits "intelligence"**
1. Some are rule\-based systems, others are learned from data\.

**Today, the best AIs are learned**
1. Machine learning systems

				     + data
\[ input \] → \[ model \] → \[ "intelligence" \]

1. They can scale a lot more when the branching factor is high; there can be an infinite number of rules for complex games with high \# of branches

## 1.2 Trend 2: Deep Learning Fever

* Deep learning learns representations from data; self\-learned features instead of manually hand\-designing features
	* AlexNet performed much better on the ImageNet data than the hand\-designed features

* Deep learning is very "modular"
	* E\.g\. you can combine image deep features \+ text deep features \+ deep classifier
## 1.3 Trend 3: LLMs Are Bringing AI to Everyone
* The number of parameters in models are continually increasing\.
* Foundational models lead to **emergence** → completing tasks that it was not trained to do\.
* It enables us to push into other domains:
	* Predicting 3D stucture of proteins \(protein folding\)
	* Writes code based on text comments
	* Generate images based on text
* **AI will reshape our social norms and the very essence of how we interact with each other**\.

## 1.4 Trend 4: Ethical AI
* People are biased; ML\-systems can protentially decrease bias but also amplify bias\.
	* E\.g\. there is an ML model used nationwide to predict future criminals; it's biased against blacks\.

* There's a lot of concerns about **privacy and surveillance** with regards to AI\.
* Some of the major issues with AI include:
	* Opacity of predictions
	* Biased decisions
	* Manipulation of behavior
	* Automation and employment
	* Decisions by proxy
	* Existential risk

# 2 Course Logistics
* You will learn the **fundamentals of ML**
* We will cover:
	* Various learning settings
		* Supervised, unsupervised, self\-supervised, RL, …\.
	* Key modeling approaches
		* Linear models, neural nets, decision trees, boosting, kernels, clustering, transformers, …
	* Main tools
		* Optimization, EM, regularization, bias\-variance tradeoff, …
	* Ethical boundaries
		* Explainability, algorithmic bias, privacy, …
