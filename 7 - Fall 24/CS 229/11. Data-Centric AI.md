# Lifecycle of an ML Project

## Data
* Ensure that the data is labeled consistently. To do so:
	* Ask two independent labelers to label a sample of images
	* Measure consistency between labelers to discover where they disagree.
	* For classes where they disagree, revise labeling instructions until they become consistent.

# Small Data and Label Consistency
* When datasets are small, label consistency is extremely important.

## Clean Vs Noisy Data
* You have 500 examples, and 12% of the examples are noisy (incorrectly or inconsistently labeled).
* The following are about equally effective:
	* Clean up the noise
	* Collect another 500 new examples (double the training set)
* With a data centric view, there is significant of room for improvement in problems with <10,000 examples
