# What is an Ecological Community?
* A group of interacting species.
* Community ecology is all about interactions.
* If species didn’t interact, communities would just be a sum of their parts.
* Interactions lead to nonlinearity.
* Nonlinearity is what is interesting in ecology.

## Examples
### Hawaiian Endemic Birds
* These birds are on the decline in recent years.

* Looking at the middle graph, their area of detection is much less ⟶ moved to higher elevations.

* **Key Idea:** understanding declines of species requires thinking about ecological communities.

## Species Interactions
* Competition
* Consumption (predation, herbivory. parasitism)
* Faciliation (mutualism)

## Emergent Properties of Ecological Communities
* Diversity
* Biomass, abundance
* Function
	* Material production
	* Water and air purification
	* Nutrient cycling
	* Regulation of noxious species

# Measuring and Comparing Communities
* We mainly measure the number of species by counting!

## Rarefaction Curves
* We can use **rarefaction curves** to show the sufficiency of sampling effort.
	* This curve answers: How to know when we've counted enough?

* Rarefactions are sometimes not saturated (e.g. hard to plateau on the number of species)

## Shannon Index
* Shannon index is used to **compare ecological diversity**
![Pasted image 20241029112931](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241029112931.png)
* One of the most commonly used species diversity index is the **Shannon Index**

## Rank Abundance Curve
* Shows the distribution of species abundances ⟶ shows both species richness and evenness.
* Each data point = 1 species
* Species richness is represented by the **number of different species** on the chart (how many species were ranked on the x axis).
* Species evenness is represented by the **slope** of the line that fits the graph.

# Comparing Compositions
![Pasted image 20241029113318](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241029113318.png)
* We can use **Sorenson's Simliarity Coefficient**
![Pasted image 20241029113337](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241029113337.png)
* In this case, Site 1 and Site 2 share **two common species**

# Summary
* Ecological communities describe groups of interacting species
* To estimate diversity, we need to account for sampling effort
* To compare diversity across communities, we can use:
	* Species richness
	* Evenness (Shannon’s index)
	* Similarity (Sorenson’s index)
	* Statistical ordination
* Species diversity depends on scale:
	* Alpha (local species richness)
	* Beta (species turnover between sites)
	* Gamma (regional species richness)
