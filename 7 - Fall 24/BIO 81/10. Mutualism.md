# Community Ecology
* A species’ realized niche is the outcome of processes working at multiple scales of biological organization

* A community is the sum of all interacting populations in a habitat
* Community has emergent properties (e.g. diversity, biomass)

# Species Interactions
* Different species can interact in a variety of ways
* Can define nature of interaction based on whether reciprocal effects are positive, negative, or neutral
* Many possibilities using all combinations of none (0), positive (+), and negative (-) effects.

# Mutualism
* Historically, mutualism viewed as unimportant ⟶ now there is an emerging view.
	* Every plant and animal may be considered a super organism in which multiple species function to maintain the whole

## Categorizing Mutualisms

## Key Details
* Mutualistic interactions represent a balance of costs & benefits.
	* For aphids, cost of ants on growth and reproduction are outweighed by the benefits of predator protection.
	* So net interaction is positive, i.e. a mutualism.
* Are there conditions in which mutualisms are more or less beneficial?
* Outcome of mutualism depends on context in which interaction occurs
	* Could be changes in density of competitors or predators, or the conditions & resources in a local environment
* Most mutualistic interactions occur along a continuum from + to -
* One hypothesis is that **mutualisms are more important in stressful conditions**

# Ecological Impact of Mutualism
**Case study: fungi that feed plants**
* Based on reciprocal trade
	* Plants trade fixed C (~15% of net carbon budget)
	* Fungi trade soil resources (e.g. up ~90% of plant N )

**Mutualism expands the realized niche**

**Global scale distributions strongly linked to mutualism**
* Mycorrhizal mutualisms 
	* In mycorrhizal mutualism, the plant provides the fungus with carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis, while the fungus helps the plant by enhancing nutrient and water uptake from the soil. This mutualistic relationship primarily involves the exchange of nutrients, which are trophic benefits, for both the plant and the fungus.

* **Mutualism can lead to greater species diversity and productivity**

# Summary
* Mutualisms are ubiquitous (and really cool)!
	* Wide array of benefits exchanged between species
* Mutualism is not altruism!
	* Understanding when mutualisms are most beneficial requires careful accounting of costs and benefits
* Mutualisms impact many important ecological features of species (e.g. the niche) and emergent properties of communities (e.g. biodiversity)
