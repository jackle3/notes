**The Process of Ecology: Experimental Design and Scientific Inference**

* Modern ecology emphasizes rigorous scientific method -> without it, easy to tell "just so stories"

# Hypothetico-deductive method
* Recall that the steps of this method is: Observation -> Question -> Hypothesis -> Prediction -> Experiment.

## Observation
* We can observe phenomena about the world.
	* *E.g. Global amphibian populations are declining.*
* Observation includes reading other literature in the field, as well as reading graphs like the one below.

## Question
* Based on the observation, we can come up with a few questions. Usually this directly follows from your observation.
	* *E.g. Why are amphibian populations declining?*

## Hypothesis
* These are like possible explanations to the question. Some examples include:
	* Climate change, global warming
* For any question, there can be *many* hypotheses that are correct.

### Parasite Hypothesis
* A possible hypothesis for the decreased populations is that trematode parasites (e.g. ribeiroia) cause limb deformities in amphibians
	* Parasite grows from bird, then affects the snail, which produces something that affects tadpoles, which lead to deformity.
![Pasted image 20241001104835](Pasted%20image%2020241001104835.png)

* As the density of the parasite increases, survivorship decreases and abnormalities increase in the frogs.
![Pasted image 20241001105015](Pasted%20image%2020241001105015.png)

* This increased parasite load leads to abnormalities that increase mortality.
![Pasted image 20241001105035](Pasted%20image%2020241001105035.png)

* **Note**: Amphibian deformities have been observed well before amphibian declines
	* However, frequency has increased from 5% historical levels to >90% in some ponds.
	* This leads to a **new question:** Why are amphibian deformities on the rise?

## Prediction
* Given a question and hypothesis, we can come up with predictions that can be experimented to confirm or deny our hypothesis.
* Predictions **should provide strong evidence**:
	* Direct measures -> there shouldn't be additional unconsidered parameters.
	* Unique predictions

**Question:** Why are amphibian deformities on the rise?
**Hypothesis:** Pesticides increases susceptibility to trematode parasites.

**Bad Prediction:** ponds near farms will have more frog deformities.
* There are a lot of different variables in farms; they might not even be using pesticides.

**Good Prediction:** ponds with high pesticide levels will have more frog deformities.

## Experiment
There are two types of experiments:
* **Correlational (observational):** makes use of natural variation to look for the effect of one factor on another.
	* Often easier to do than a manipulative study; sometimes its the only reasonable type of study you can do (e.g. studying wildfires)
	* Less handling and interference with existing organisms/ecosystems -> reduces stress or damage on organisms.
	* Keeping biologically integrated units intact.
	* Dealing with biologically relevant variation
* **Manipulative:** where the investigator actually does something to the system and measures the effects of these manipulations on variables of interest.
	* Avoids two major problems of correlational studies:
		* **Third variables**
		* **Reverse causation**
	* “Correlation does not mean causation”.

### Hypothesis and Statistics
* There are two kinds of hypothesis that you can test.
	* Null hypothesis -> the one where nothing exciting is happening.
	* Alternative hypothesis -> the one in favor of your hypothesis.
* When doing statistical testing, you are trying to reject the null hypothesis and prove that there is something going on.
* **P-value:** If the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of an even this extreme or greater?
* **Rejecting the null does not necessarily mean the alternative is correct.**

### Correlational experiment example
* The hypothesis/prediction we are testing here is the **alternative hypothesis.**

![Pasted image 20241001105950](Pasted%20image%2020241001105950.png)


### Third variables
* An underlying third variable might drive A and B, leading us to think there is a correlation between them.
![Pasted image 20241001110057](Pasted%20image%2020241001110057.png)

* For example, as the number of ice cream sales increase, drowning accidents increase.
	* However, warm weather is the third variable that drives both up.

### Reverse Causation
* Suppose we were trying to study if A causes B. It could be that B actually causes A, but we can't know that from observational studies.
![Pasted image 20241001110230](Pasted%20image%2020241001110230.png)


### Manipulative experiment example
* They started with a **manipulative field experiment**. The treatments were:
	* Presence of trematodes
		* Fine mesh to exclude ribeiroia
		* Wide mesh to allow ribeiroia
	* Presence of pesticides

![Pasted image 20241001110420](Pasted%20image%2020241001110420.png)

* They found that when blocking access from trematodes, there were no deformities regardless of pesticides.
* Further, introducing both trematodes and pesticides significantly increased deformities.
	* This is an **interaction** -> effect of pesticides depend on the level of trematode presence.

* They continued to test further with a **manipulative lab experiment**:
	* Found that presence of pesticides increased the number of cysts per tadpole.

### Laboratory Study
* We shouldn't go straight to a laboratory study because:
	* Not a representative environment
	* Conclusions limited to the specific conditions of the lab experiment
	* Generalizations are stronger from field experiments

## Cycle

# Ecological Problems
* Even with many experiments on ecological problems, it can be inconclusive.
	* E.g. we can't be certain that the pesticide related deformities caused amphibian population declines.

* **Ecological problems involve multiple scales of biological organization.**
	* Individuals (individual frogs), populations (populations of frog in a pond), and communities (group of many populations including frogs, bird, parasites, etc).

# Minimal Features of Experimental Design
Good experimental design allows us to assess **how much of the variation is due to what we are interested in** and **how much is caused by other random or unintentional variation**. 

The minimal features include:
* **Knowledge of initial conditions**
	* E.g. what was the historical levels of smoke before industrialization?

* **Adequate controls**
	* Control is a reference against which results of an experimental manipulation can be compared.
	* In some cases, controls can show that the experimental manipulation did nothing.
	* Sometimes more than one control is needed to avoid artefacts.
	* Sometimes (but not often) a control is not required.

* **Replication**
	* Replication causes the effect of random variation to cancel out.
	* Replicate measures must be independent of each other.
		* Any measurement is just as likely to have a positive deviation from the baseline due to random variation as a negative one.
		* When true, random deviations cancel out and the mean of the sample will be close to the mean of the population.
		* **Pseudoreplications:** measuring different subjects, but the subjects are not independent from one another. This can come from:
			* Shared enclosures between subjects
				* Solution: condense and repeat -> condense measurements of subjects in enclosure to one measure, and repeat with multiple enclosures.
			* Genetic relatedness
			* Measurements through space and time -> affected by spatial or temporal correlation.

* **Randomization**
	* Randomization means **every individual experimental subject** has the **same chance** as any other individual **of being assigned in each experimental group**.
	* Careful randomization is needed in order to avoid unintentionally introducing third variables.

* **Trade-offs**
	* Generalism vs. Confidence
		* e.g. do results apply to all forests or just this one?
	* Sophistication vs. Realism
		* e.g. multi-factor lab studies vs. whole lake manipulations


# Summary
* No single study can prove a hypothesis
* Ecological problems are complex, involve multiple scales
