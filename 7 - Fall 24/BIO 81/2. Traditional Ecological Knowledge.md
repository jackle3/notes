# What is TEK?
* TEK is on-going accumulation of knowledge, practice, and belief about **relationships between living beings** in a specific ecosystem that is **acquired by indigenous people** over hundreds/thousands of years through direct contact with the environment, handed down through generations, and used for life-sustaining ways.

* **Reciprocal restoration:** mutu==ally reinforci==ng restoration of land and culture such that repair of ecosystem services contributes to cultural revitalization, and renewal of culture promotes restoration of ecological integrity.

## TEK is Problematic
* By saying its **traditional**, it's not very accurate.
	* The term implies it's a thing of the past -- it also includes modern ideas.
* By saying **ecological**, it's also not very accurate.
	* TEK covers everything, including not just ecology but also other fields.
* By saying **knowledge**, it's also not very accurate.
	* It includes not only knowledge but also how you live, the culture, etc

* Alternatively, you could use the term indigenous knowledge (IK) instead of TEK.
	* But TEK does not necessarily have to indigenous.

## TEK/IK is gaining momentum
* Ecological Society of America (ESA) TEK chapter since 2002
* Center for Braiding Indigenous Knowledges and Science (CBIKS) since 2023
* Robin Kimmerer
	* Leading indigenous scholar exploring TEK, wrote *Braiding Sweetgrass*
	* Also does reciprocal restoration
* Dennis Martinez
	* Kincentric ecology -- awareness that life in any environment is viable only when humans view the life surrounding them as kin. 

# How does TEK differ from SEK?
* SEK stands for Scientific Ecological Knowledge

| Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK)                                                                                                                | Scientific ecological knowledge (SEK)                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Intergenerational*<br><br>- failures and success develop over years                                                                                  | *Individual*<br><br>- individual research and emphasis on authorship                                         |
| *Participants*<br><br>- participants of ecosystem and landscape                                                                                       | *Observers*<br><br>- emphasis on observation/distancing oneself                                              |
| *Holistic*<br><br>- not just knowledge/ecology, it's everything about how you live                                                                    | *Analytical*<br><br>- specialized into specific fields of research                                           |
| *Local (place-based)*<br><br>- local to a single place; want to understand local ecosystem and landscape                                              | *Global (general principles)*<br><br>- try to find conclusions that are global; find generalized theories    |
| *Time-tested*<br><br>- researchers try things and learn from how it reacts over time; learn from trial and error as a community                       | *Hypothesis testing*                                                                                         |
| *Animism*<br><br>- don't think of humans as exceptional; they are just one part of ecosystem. other organisms are just as important/spiritual/soulful | *Dualism*<br><br>- there is a subject (the ecosystem) and an observer -> distancing researching from subject |


## TEK's common threads
* Gratitude and respect
* Reciprocity
* Responsibility
* Kincentric, not anthropocentric
	* Anthropocentric -> regarding humankind as the central or most important element of existence
	* Kincentric -> awareness that life in any environment is viable only when humans view the life surrounding them as kin. 


# Why is TEK important?

## Myths about TEK
* Myth: New technologies make TEK irrelevant.
	* Truth: Sustainability is a moral, not technological, undertaking.
* Myth: Native peoples ruined landscapes, too.
	* Truth: Native Americans continued for 13,000 years.
* Myth: Indigenous groups lacked machines to destroy habitat.
	* Truth: “Certainly capable of doing more damage than actually done” (Hughes 1983)

## Problems about SEK
* SEK’s dualism tied to capitalism; nature as commodity
* "Green growth” (the idea that tech will save us) not sustainable

**Solution: TEK as a guide and SEK as a tool -> two-eyed seeing**

## Two-eyed seeing
* learning to see from...
	* one eye with the **strengths of Indigenous knowledges** and ways of knowing
	* other eye with the **strengths of mainstream Western knowledges** and ways of knowing
