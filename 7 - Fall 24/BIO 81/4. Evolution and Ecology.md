# Evolution
* Alfred Russell Wallace: "Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species" --> **Implies the theory of natural selection**
	* Modern day sloths are found in the same areas as the fossils of ancient mega-sloths.
	* Two modern species of lizards that are related are usually found in the same space.

* Define **evolution** as the change in the frequency of alleles within a population.
	* (Micro)evolution occurs at the level of populations (group of same species).
	* (Macro)evolution, or long-term patterns of evolution, shaped by speciation, extinction, radiations.

* Define **adaptation** as features of organisms that improve their ability to survive and reproduce.

* The **mechanisms of evolution are:**
	* Mutation
		* Alleles change due to mutations; spontaneous changes in genetic code.
	* Genetic drift
		* Changes in gene frequency that are caused entirely by chance.
		* E.g. tree is struck by lightning; grass is trampled on by elephant; genes can't be passed on to influence population.
	* Gene flow
		* Movement of genetic material (e.g. spores or gametes) between populations.
		* It can bring mutations from one population to another population.
		* *Gene flow can cause harm/damage* -> genes that are adapted to one environment can be maladaptive for other environments.
			* Birds with genes suited for warm weather might be damaging for birds with colder weather.
	* Natural selection
		* The only mechanism that consistently causes positive adaptation.

# Natural Selection
* The conditions for evolution by natural selection are:
	1. Variation between individuals.
	2. Some of this variation is heritable (can be passed on).
	3. **Actual** population growth is **less** than **potential** population growth.
	4. Individuals vary in the number of descendants they leave behind.
	5. Number of descendants **depends on interaction** between phenotype and environment.

* Define **fitness** as the genetic contribution of an individual to future generations.
	* Individual genotypes are more or less fit **relative** to each other
		* Individuals with more offspring are fitter.
	* Fitness is **relative to environment** -> land vs. ocean, etc.
	* Natural selection is "survival of the fittest".

* The modes of natural selection include: Directional, Stabilizing, Disruptive

## Directional
* Consider Darwin's Finches
* There is large variation in the number of seeds and the fraction of large seeds on the finches island.
![Pasted image 20241003105939](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003105939.png)


* In 1976:
	* This was before the drought, when there were more small seeds.
* In 1978:
	* This was after the drought, when there were more large seeds.
	* They found that beak sizes got larger, in order for the finches to eat the large seeds.

* In directional selection, **one extreme phenotype is favored.**
	* In this case, it was following a selection event (the drought, which changed the seed sizes)

## Stabilizing
* Consider a situation where exposure to wasps, the selection event, leads to differing sizes of the galls --> birds tend to be more attracted to certain sizes of galls, eating them.
* After wasps are exposed and birds eat them, you can see that the extreme phenotypes (the small galls) are eliminated.

![Pasted image 20241003110557](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003110557.png)

* In stabilizing selection, **extreme phenotypes are eliminated from the population**.

## Disruptive
![Pasted image 20241003110733](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003110733.png)
* In disruptive selection, **more extreme phenotypes are fabored over intermediate** in the same environment.

# Consequences of Natural Selection

## CKH Study
* Clausen, Keck, & Heisey studied CA plants with broad distributions.
* For example consider the species *Achillea millefolium* ("Yarrow").
	* The red points are where people have observed the plant -> very broad distribution.
	![500](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003111733.png)

* CKH noticed that plants **differed morphologically** across locations in CA.
	* In beach areas, you get very large plants. As you go higher up, you get smaller plants.
![Pasted image 20241003111915](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003111915.png)

* They wanted to know whether the differences in plant size is due to local evolution.
	* However, they can't just say so because there is a lot of additional factors that lead to genetic variations.

* Define **phenotypic plasticity** as the potential of a single genotype respond to different environments.

### Common Garden Experiment
* CKH took a bunch of species and grew them in **common gardens**, which make it so that all the species grow in the same environment.
![Pasted image 20241003112230](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003112230.png)

### Results
![500](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003112748.png)
* Stanford has a nice environment, Mather is middle, and Timberline has harsh environments.
* Large amount of genetic variation (within gardens)
	* In the same garden, the stem lengths of plants are significantly different across species.
* Strong environmental effect (across gardens)
	* Notice that some plants/genotypes significantly vary based on the location that they were grown.
* Local populations better adapted
	* Plants native to Stanford are very unfit for Timberline where the environment is harsh.
	* Some plants that don't perform well in Stanford perform very well in Timberline.

## Ecomorph
* Define **ecomorph** as local population of a species that has developed distinct physical characteristics to adapt to its environment

* Consider the moth population below. The blue circles indicate populations with black wings, and white circles indicate populations with white wings.
* Notice that during industrial revolution, the industry areas had significant amounts of black winged moths since they blend into the pollution better.
* As pollution cleared up, the white moth populations returned.

# Limits on Evolution
* The constraints on evolution include:
	* **Lack of genetic variation**
		* Natural selection cannot act on traits that donâ€™t exist yet in the population.

	* **Evolutionary history**
		* Evolution is constrained by past events and works with available materials
		* E.g. pandas, which have herbivorous diets, developed thumbs (which other bears don't have) in order to help them eat bamboo better.
			* In bears, there was a wrist bone that was sticking out but was not very used.
			* Pandas eventually evolved and used this wrist bone as a thumb.
			* **Convergent evolution**: red pandas, which are actually more related to raccoons than bears, also developed a thumb on its own from the same wrist bone.

	* **Ecological trade-offs**
		* *Single trait trade-off*: For a certain trait, increased performance in one environment necessitates decreased performance in another.
			![Pasted image 20241003113842](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003113842.png)

		* *Multi trait trade-off*: Multiple traits can both be good in an environment, but they are limited by resources. Organism have to choose which trait to invest in.
			![Pasted image 20241003114052](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003114052.png)

		* For example, trees have a root to shoot ratio, and they need to do a trade-off on allocating how much to grow their roots vs how much to grow their shoots (leaves).
			* In areas with high precipitation, there are more shoots than roots.
			* In areas with low precipitation, there are more roots than shoots.

# Evolution and Ecology
* Evolution can occur in **ecological** time.
	* Evolutionary changes can happen relatively quickly, within a time frame that impacts and is observed within living ecosystems. 
* In big horned sheep, hunters tended to hunt sheep with large sizes.
	* As a result, the size and horn size of big-horned sheep decreased over time.
