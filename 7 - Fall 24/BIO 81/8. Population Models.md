# Counting Exercise
* How do we know the size of a population?
* Easy to measure in the lab, but difficult in the field
* A number of sampling and statistical methods available

## Fixed Area Count
* Useful for counting organisms that are not able to move:
	* Go out with a quadrat (fixed area frame)
	* Count individuals in the quadrat
	* Gives estimate of density of organisms in a square unit

## Mark-recapture Studies
* Can be used to estimate population size for mobile animals

# Recall: Population Models
![[Pasted image 20241017105621.png]]
* These models are pretty simple. Natural populations tend to fluctuate a lot.

## Modified Population Models
1. Delayed density dependence.
2. Demographic & environmental stochasticity
3. Metapopulation models


# Delayed Density Dependence
* Density dependence is the red line ⟶ as the population density increases, population growth rate decreases.
* In delayed density dependence, our growth rate depends on some density **in this past**.
	* Model this lag as the time $t - \tau$ ⟶ the point that our model depends on.

## Example
* The species below follows delayed density dependence!
	* The graphs each have around a delay of around $4 \tau = 4 \text{ years}$.

## Discrete Model, Fixed $\tau$
* In the models below, we've fixed $\tau$.
* Notice that the models still how the oscillation of the delayed density dependence model.

# Metapopulation Models
* Takes into account immigration and emigration into and from populations.

## Levins Metapopulation Model
* In the diagram, orange (pluses) are present, black (minuses) are absent.
![[Pasted image 20241017112654.png]]
* $C$ is colonized. These are patches that go from empty to occupied.
	* $c$ is the per-patch probability of colonization.
	* $C = c(1-P) = \text{prob of colonization} \times \text{prop of empty patches}$
* $P$ is occupied. These are patches that have already been occupied.
* $E$ is extinct. These are patches that go from occupied to empty.
	* $E = eP = \text{prob of extinction} \times \text{prop of occupied patches}$

## Island-mainland Model
* The equilibrium patch occurs when $\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$ (no change in patches). We can then solve for the estimate equilibrium $\hat{P}$.

## Internal Colonization Model
* If we assume that all the colonization comes internally from the patches that are already occupied, then the probability of colonization depends on the # of occupied patches ($P$)
* Notice that we add $cP$ to the equation ⟶ $c$ now depends on $P$.
* $\hat{P}$ is the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches.
