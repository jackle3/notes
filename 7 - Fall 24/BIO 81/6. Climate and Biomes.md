# Climate and Biomes
* **Biomes**: the convergence of ecosystems. This is why distant ecosystems can look so similar.
* Definition: Biomes are large-scale biological communities shaped by the physical environment in which they are found.

## Climate
* Climate is the predominant factor in **determining the biomes**. It determines:
	* Water availability and the Thermal Environment
		* Both control where/how organisms live
	* Vegetation and animals that rely on vegetation

# Temperature Differentials
* Climate is the primary driver of PE — a measure of the amount of water that could be evaporated from the surface and transpired by plants if sufficient water were available.
* There's substantial differentials in temperature (TDs) over Earth. Caused by:
	* Variations in incoming solar radiation related to Earth surface
	* Simple physical principles that determine how solar energy is distributed

## **1. Solar radiation is distributed unevenly**
* **Angle if incidence** affects the incoming radiation — more spread out at high latitudes

* **Depth of atmosphere** also affects it — more atmosphere layers at high latitudes

* **Albedo** — proportion of incoming radiation that is reflected. Average on earth is 30%; icy regions have high albedo.

* As a result of all three factors, polar regions received only **40%** of the solar energy received at the tropics.

## 2. Atmospheric Convection

**Adiabatic heating/cooling**
* Defined as the decrease in temperature due to an increase in volume.

## Tropical Circulation Cells
![[Pasted image 20241010113540.png]]
* The **Hadley Cells** are a global atmospheric circulation that moves air from the equator to the poles and back.

# Rotation
* Higher latitudes have a lower rotational velocity.
	* E.g. if you throw an object south from the equator, it will deflect east due to a faster rotational velocity than the surface it is passing over.
* Wind patterns are driven by this **Coriolis effect**

## Westerlies
* The westerlies, anti-trades, or prevailing westerlies, are prevailing winds from the west toward the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude.
* Caused by the Coriolis effect.

## Tropical Easterlies
* A prevailing wind pattern that blows from the subtropical high-pressure belt towards the equator.
* These winds are moving down towards the equator, but it deflects west because its rotating slower than the equator.

# Modifiers of Regional Climate
1. Effect of oceans & landmasses
2. Effects of mountains on precipitation & temperature.
3. Temporal variation

## 1. Oceans moderate continental climates
* The closer you are to the coast, the less temperatures fluctuate because there isn't the water with the high specific heat capacity.

* The oceans **moderate temp along coastlines**.
	* SF, which is by the coast, has less temp fluctuations.

## 2. Effect of altitude: cooling, rain shadow
![[Pasted image 20241010114337.png]]
* This effect is seen in mountains, where the mountain creates a rain shadow.

## 3. Temporal variation: seasonality

# Dividing up the world’s biota
* **Biome** – areas on the earth where the plant & animal distribution have similar or shared characteristics
* **Latitude** – Tropical, temperate, boreal, polar
* **Physiognomy** – the look or structure of the dominant vegetation in a community

# Ecosystem Engineering
* Sometimes the ecosystem itself has "engineering" to prevent issues.

## Beaver example
* Beavers build dams which create channel avulsion (a natural process that occurs when a river's flow is diverted from its established channel to a new course on the floodplain)
