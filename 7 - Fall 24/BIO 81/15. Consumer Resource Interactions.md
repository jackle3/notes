# How Does Herbivory Affect Plants?
![Pasted image 20241116164132](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241116164132.png)

## 1. What Do Herbivores Do to Individual Plants?
* Consume entire plant (e.g., seed), causing death of individual
* Consume plant parts (e.g., leaves), but not killing the plant
* Effects depend on plant parts eaten. Thus, consuming:
	* roots reduces nutrient uptake
	* leaves reduces photosynthetic area
	* leaves, twigs, stems reduces competitive ability
	* flowers, fruits, seed reduces contribution to next generation

* For seeds, consumption means death of individual
* For fruits, consumption means dispersal to new locations

## 2. Can Herbivory Help Plants grow/reproduce?
* Plants may overcompensate by growing more

## 3. Herbivores Effect on Plant Populations
![Pasted image 20241116164443](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241116164443.png)

* Insect herbivores cause widespread tree mortality
* Plants treated with insecticides experienced large increases in growth
* Herbivores can affect spatial distribution of plants

## Summary
* Herbivory can either kill a plant or reduce its growth and reproduction
* Consumption can sometimes be beneficial to the plant
* However, herbivory is generally harmful to individual plants
* Herbivory may change abundances and distributions of plants

# How Can We Predict Consumer-resource Outcomes?

## Predators
1. Kill prey immediately after attacking
2. Consume multiple prey individuals during lifetime

* E.g. Data on historical trapping records show that snowshoe hare and Canada lynx populations follow a **10-year cycle of rise and fall**
	* Hare populations peak every 10 years due to high birth rates but drop due to predation and food scarcity.
	* Lynx numbers increase as hare populations grow and decline as hare numbers drop.
	* Lynx and other predators (e.g., coyotes) heavily prey on hares during peak hare populations.
	* At high densities, hares consume large amounts of vegetation, which can limit food availability.
	* Despite high-quality food supplements, hare numbers still decline, suggesting complex factors than food and predation alone.

## Prey Growth
![Pasted image 20241116165112](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241116165112.png)

**Consider how prey population increases & decreases due to predator**

* If there are no predators, **prey grows exponentially** ⟶ $rN$
* Prey decreases based on the **consumption rate of the predator**
	* Let $a$ be the capture efficiency of the predator.
	* Then the decrease rate is $\alpha NP$ where N is # of prey and P is # of predators

* Let $b$ be the conversion efficiency between consuming prey and growing.

## Model
![Pasted image 20241116165538](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241116165538.png)

## Model Assumptions
1. Prey will increase exponentially in the absence of predator, i.e., no carrying capacity
2. Predators will starve/die in absence of the prey, i.e., won’t switch to another prey
3. Predators can consume indefinite quantities of prey, i.e., predators never get full
4. No environmental complexity

# Prey Zero Growth Isocline
* What will the **predator population** be when the **prey population growth equals zero**?
![Pasted image 20241116165706](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241116165706.png)
* In other words: When prey mortality due to predation ⟶ inherent growth rate

![Pasted image 20241116165901](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241116165901.png)
* This model differs from the competition model as the **prey population's change is independent of its current population size**

# Cycle
* With **predators above prey isocline** & **prey below predator isocline**, both populations decline due to scarce prey and high predator demand
* With **few prey and predators**, prey will rebound as **predator population decline**
* Eventually, rising prey will cross the predator isocline, allowing predator growth as food becomes abundant
* When predators cross the prey isocline, predation pressure causes prey decline, restarting the cycle
