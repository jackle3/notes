# Lotka Volterra Competition
* Used to predict the outcome of competitions
	* Population oscillations in predator-prey models
	* **Competitive exclusion principle** ⟶ 2 species competing for identical resources cannot coexist
* Recall the logistic equation for growth rate:

* Competition **reduces growth rate of original population**

## Predicting Competition Outcome
* To determine when population of each species stops changing, requires knowing how $N_1$ and $N_2$ changes over time
* If $N_2$ increases while $N_1$ tends to 0, then species 2 will drive species 1 to extinction and win the competition.

### Summary
* Population size of **species 1** will be unchanging at any combination of $N1$ and $N2$ on the **blue line**.
* Population size of **species 2** will be unchanging at any combination of $N1$ and $N2$ on the **green line**.

* To predict a population's trajectory, we should:
	1. Know current population size species 1 and species 2
	2. Whether that point is above or below each species' isocline

# Scenarios of ZNGI

## Species 1 Wins
* Occurs when **isoclines do not cross** but **species 1 isocline is above species 2** ⟶ does not need to be parallel.
![Pasted image 20241111151005](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241111151005.png)
* Points in the bottom left will see an increase in both the N1 and N2 populations.

![Pasted image 20241111151108](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241111151108.png)
* Effectively, it will keep pushing it towards the center component, at which point N2 decreases.

## Species 2 Wins
* Occurs when **isoclines do not cross** but **species 2 isocline is above species 1** ⟶ does not need to be parallel.

## Scenario 3: Priority Effects
![Pasted image 20241111151322](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241111151322.png)
* **Priority Effects** ⟶ overall winner is determined by which of the orange or white regions that the population trajectories enter first
	* If we enter the **white region** first, then species 1 wins.
	* If we enter the **orange region** first, then species 2 wins.

## Scenario 4: Stable Coexistence
![Pasted image 20241111151640](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241111151640.png)
![Pasted image 20241111151648](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241111151648.png)
* Once we reach the intersection, neither population will grow any further ⟶ they will stabilize at this equilibrium density
* This is the **only scenario** where competitive exclusion does not occur.

## Example

![Pasted image 20241112104410](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241112104410.png)
* Both species cannot coexist.
* Either wild dog or lion wins; but depends on who enters the population trajectory first (priority effect).
	* If in white zone, wild dog will win
	* If in orange zone, lion will win

# Summary
**How can we predict competition outcome?**
* Lotka-Volterra model describes how two species competing for same resources influence each other's population growth.
* Each species’ growth rate is reduced due to the presence and impact of the other.
* The model predicts whether species will coexist, one will drive the other to extinction, or reach a stable balance.
