# National Parks and the Engineering of Eden

***Harry Eugene Walker (1947 - 1971)** 
* Went west and discovered Yellowstone national park
* Set up his own camp site
* Bear came to the campsite and killed Harry; family sued national park

**Yellowstone** (1872) was the first national park to be protected
* Preserve all timber, mineral deposits, etc in their *natural* condition.
* This also meant **garbage dumps** in the area were closed.

Bears had been using the garbage dumps as a source of food
* Biologists warned them that it would be **hazardous to close the dumps** because the bears would attack visitors (bc they were hungry).

# Ecology

**Definition:** The **scientific study** of the processes influencing the ==distribution and abundance== of organisms, the ==interactions among organisms==, and the interactions between organisms and the transformation and ==flux of energy and matter==.

* Flux -> movement of energy and matter, such as via photosynthesis

**When considering ecological questions, we need to think about...**
* Individual
	* single organisms of a particular species
	* Will the individual sequoia tree be affected by climate change?
* Population
	* group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area and interact with each other.
	* Will the population be affected? what if some grow better due to climate change?
* Community
	* all the different populations (various species) that live and interact in a specific area.
	* How will it affect the local community or organisms and trees?
* Ecosystem 
	* all the living organisms (the community) in an area along with the non-living components of their environment, such as air, water, and soil.
	* The interactions between organisms and their physical environment define an ecosystem.
	* Will the decrease in the number of sequoias change the ecosystem.


# Scientific Method

## Basic Sequence

question -> hypothesis -> test

**Hypothesis:** a clear, falsifiable statement giving plausible explanation for a question or observation.

Example:
* **Question:** Does closing the dumps in Yellowstone affect the bears?
* **Hypothesis:** Bear populations are no longer viable following the closure of the dumps
* **Test:** They unintentionally tested this, and found that that the population of bears did decrease into near-extinction status.


## How to test?
* The basic of the testing approach is the *hypothetico-deductive* method.

* You use observation to identify species (often through guide books or taxonomic keys
