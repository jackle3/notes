# Species Interactions
* There are a lot of biotic interactions involving consumption.
* Herbivores are those who consume plant matter.

# Herbivory
* A type of plant-animal interaction
* **(non-lethal)** consumption of plant tissues/fluids
* It's an element of food chain ⟶ herbivores remove 18% of terrestrial plant biomass; 51% in aquatic systems.

* Herbivory is an **EcoEvo** (ecological evolution) factor ⟶ phytocentric view
	* Impact on plants and populations
	* Evolutionary force ⟶ plant traits
	* Shapes plant communities (e.g. via preferential eating)

## Plant-Animal Interactions
* These interactions can be defined on the basis of the sign of the effect (pos or neg) of interacting species on one another

## Herbivory in Ecology and Evolution
**What prevents herbivores from just consuming all the greens of the world?**

1. Plant traits:
	* Chemical defenses (secondary metabolites)
	* Physical defenses (mechanical)
		* Usually effective against vertebrates: Thorns, spines, hairs, toughness(?)
		* Other also effective against invertebrates: Hairs (pubescence), toughness(?)
	* There are **two modes of defenses:**
		* Present all the time ⟶ **constitutive**
		* Only when damage occurs ⟶ **induced**
			* Induced defenses are those that are produced or increased in response to a threat, such as herbivores, rather than being always present at a high level (which would be characteristic of constitutive defenses).
1. External forces
	* Biotic defenses ("bodyguards")
		* Other animals defend the plant (e.g. ants and wasps defend nectar producers)

* These defenses come from **evolution by natural selection**

## Herbivory as a Selective Force
The three requisites for Natural Selection
* Intraspecific variation in some plant trait/s
	* E.g. plants develop cyanogenesis (capacity to release HCN) to deter predators
* Such variation leads to differences in fitness (Reproductive Success, Survival)
	* Does variation in herbivory affect plant fitness ⟶ yes it does. As herbivory increases, survival rate, leaves per plant, and flower heads per plant decreases.
* Inter-individual variation leading to differences in fitness is genetically determined (heritable)
	* Does variation in herbivory have a genetic basis?
	* Yes, genes in clover determine cyanogenic capacity.

# Inter-specific Variation in Herbivory

## Resource Availability Growth Rate Hypothesis
A popular theoretical framework to explain patterns of interspecific variation in plant defense
* Environmental resource availability determines the potential intrinsic growth of plants
* Growth rates displayed by plants determine, in turn, the amount of resources allocated to production of defenses against herbivores
* Differential allocation of resources to defense OR growth constitutes a conflicting trade-off for plants

## Analytics
![Pasted image 20241027171319](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241027171319.png)

* We can measure calculate the herbivory index based on data.

* By observation, fast growing species have high herbivory indices.
