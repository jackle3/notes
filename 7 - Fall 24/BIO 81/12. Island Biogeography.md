# Island Species Richness Patterns

> [!NOTE] Biogeography
> The study of how organisms are distributed over time and over geographic areas, using historical and ecological approaches.

> [!NOTE] Metacommunities
> Metacommunity focuses on how local interactions and regional processes affect the composition of local communities

## Immigration
![[Pasted image 20241106140838.png]]
Why does the immigration rate decline as the island gains more species?
- Fewer of the immigrants are different from those already on the island
- It is more difficult for immigrants to establish in a more diverse system

## Dispersal Ability
- The bottom line is birds because they have a greater ability to travel to further islands.
