# Populations
* Definition of a population: a ==group of individuals== from the ==same species== that live together and interact with each other.
* Can sometimes be fuzzy:
	* Straightforward ⟶ lake fish, simply look at species of fish in a lake
	* More subjective ⟶ aphids (hard to tell where one population ends and another starts)
* Common thread of all populations:  ==# of individuals==
* Populations are ==highly variable== in size and over time.

## Example: N. Elephant Seal

* Y-axis is the number of births
* Open circles are the recorded population in California

## Example: Brown Tree Snake
![Pasted image 20241015104807](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241015104807.png)

* In 1950s, this snake species was introduced to Guam (which did not have native snakes).
	* Populations expanded rapidly once they were introduced ⟶ ==invasive species==
![Pasted image 20241015104901](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241015104901.png)

* Result: Decline in native species ⟶ there were no predators for the invasive snakes.
	* The arrows define when the brown tree snakes were introduced to those areas.
	* The number of **bird species declined** pretty rapidly as soon as snakes were introduced ⟶ birds not used to snakes.

# Biological Models
* Simple representations of more complex phenomena.
* Nearly always use either mathematical equations & computer simulations.
* Goal: not just represent, but to help us to understand.
	* In biology, a model is a hypothesis.
	* ==All models are wrong==, some are useful

# Population Model

## Terminology
* $N$ represents the # of individuals.
* $N_t$ represents the # of individuals in the population at time $t$ (time in some common unit)
	* $N_0$ = population size now, $N_2$ = size in 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years…
	* $N_0$ = $1000$ indvls, $N_1$ = $1230$ indvls, …..

## How Do Populations Change in Size?
* Factors causing populations to change in size:
	* B = Births and D = Deaths.
	* I = Immigrants and E = Emigrants.
* Calculating population size over time:
	* $N_t$ = current pop. size and $N_{t+1}$ = size at next time step.
$$
N_{t+1} = N_{t} + B - D + I - E
$$
* Change in Pop. Size:
$$
\Delta N = N_{t+1} - N_{t} = B - D + I - E
$$
### Expressing Change per Capita
* Per individual (per capita) birth rate is
$$
B/N = b = \text{instantaneous birth rate}
$$
* Per individual (per capital) death rate is
$$
D/N = d = \text{instantaneous death rate}
$$
* Units of $b$ and $d$ are the number of births or deaths per individual/per unit time.

## Key Simplifying Assumptions
* Assumption #1: there is no movement ⟶ $\Delta N = B - D$
* Assumption #2: population growth is continuous.
	* Individuals are constantly being born into or dying from the population (ex. US pop).
* Assumption #3: number of births ($B$) depends on current population size.
* Assumption #4: $b$ and $d$ are constant.
	* No matter how big the population gets, individuals have the same per capita birth and death rates.
* This makes population growth instanteous.
	* Time between $N_t$ and $N_{t+1}$ is infinitely small.

## Simple Growth Rate Equation
* With assumption #2, we can now write:$$
\Delta N = \frac{dN}{dt} = B - D
$$
* $dN/dt$ is the population growth rate.
* $dN/dt$ is the change in population size ($dN$) that occurs over a short period of time ($dt$).

## Modified Growth Rate Equation
* Recall the simple growth rate equation:
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = B - D
$$
* Substituing in per capita $b$ and $d$ ($B = bN$ and $D = dN)$:
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = bN - dN
$$
* Factoring out $N$ to simplify:
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = (b - d)N
$$
* The difference between $b$ and $d$ is the **instatenous rate of change**, called $r$.
* The ==modified growth rate equation== is:
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN
$$
### Predicting Population Size
* If we integrate the above and solve for $N_t$ we get:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dN}{dt} &= rN \\
\frac{dN}{N} &= \frac{r}{dt} \\
\int\frac{1}{N}dN &= \int r dt \\
\ln|N| &= rt + C \\
\end{align*}
$$
* This means that:
$$
N(t) = e^{rt} \cdot e^C
$$
* If we ignore the constant, we get:
$$
N_{t} = N_{0} \cdot e^{rt}
$$
## Discrete Growth Equation
* We can model discrete growth as:
$$
\begin{align*}
N_{t+1} &= N_{t} + r_{d} N_{t}\\
&= N_{t} \cdot (1 + r_{d})
\end{align*}
$$
* $r_d$ is known as the discrete growth factor ⟶ proportional change in population each time.
* Define $(1 + r_d)$ as $\lambda$ ⟶ the finite rate of increase of the discrete growth factor.
* We can rewrite the discrete growth equation as:
$$
N_{t+1} = \lambda N_{t}
$$
# Exponential Growth
* If we take the limits to infinity, observe that $\lambda = e^r$.
* The blue dots are what you get from the discrete growth equation, while the red line is the modified growth equation.

## Example
![Pasted image 20241015111803](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241015111803.png)

* Per capita rate of change is
$$
r = b - d = \frac{200}{2000} - \frac{100}{2000} = \frac{1}{20}
$$
* Population growth rate (instantaneous change in popuation size) is
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN = \frac{1}{20}(2000) = 100 \text{ per month}
$$
* Predicted population growth is
$$
N_{t} = N_{0} \cdot e^{rt} = 2000 \cdot \exp(0.05 * 3 \text{ months}) = 2,323.67
$$
## Population Doubling Time
* A population doubles when:
$$
N_{t} = 2N_{0}
$$
* This means that:
$$
\begin{align*}
2N_{0} &= N_{0} e^{rt} \\
\ln(2) &= rt \\
t_{\text{double}} &= \ln(2)/r
\end{align*}
$$

### Example
* Let $r = 0.05$
![Pasted image 20241015112647](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241015112647.png)
* Doubling time is:
$$
t_{\text{double}} = \frac{\ln(2)}{r} = 13.8629436112
$$
* The population size in 17 years is:
$$
N_{t} = N_{0} \cdot e^{rt} = 2000 \cdot \exp(0.05 \cdot 17\cdot 12) = 53,806,372.15
$$

# Refining the Model
* What doesn’t our simple model capture?
	* Assumption #4: population growth rate was constant for all months
* Even from small $N_0$ or small $r$, exponential growth models will produce astronomical population sizes ⟶ actual population growth will eventually be ==limited by availability of resources==

* When ratio of resources to individuals is high, b = high and d = low.
	* In a large population, relative to amount of resources, lower b and higher d.
* Reason why: individuals are competing for limited resources.
* **Intraspecific Competition**: reduction in performance experienced by an individual because of the presence of other individuals in the population.
