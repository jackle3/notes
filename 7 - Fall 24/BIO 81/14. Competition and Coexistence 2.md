# Altering Competition Outcome
**What factors alter competition outcome?**
1. Herbivores
2. Physical environment
3. Disturbance
4. Predation

## 1. Herbivores
* In 1981, the Ragwort plant was the superior competitor.
* After it was introduced, it declined significantly and other species took over.

## 2. Physical Environment

## 3. Disturbance
* E.g. Sea palms compete with dominant competitor mussel for attachment space

* The graph shows the population density changes from one year to the next.
	* x axis is density in year `x`
	* y axis is density in year `x + 1`
	* Dotted line is exact replacement ⟶ hypothetical scenario where population is stable (density in year `x` equals density in year `x + 1`)
	* Solid line is the actual observed relationship ⟶ because line is below dotted line, population is **decreasing**
* **Question:** How many years would it take to decline from 100 individuals to fewer than 20 individuals?
	* If density `N=100` individuals in year 0, we expect `N=22` in year 1.
	* If density `N=22` in year 1, we expect `N=8` in year 2.
	* Therefore it would take 2 years.

# Features of Competition
**What are the features of competition?**
1. Interference or exploitation competition
2. Intensity of competition among species
3. Symmetry of competition
4. Competition and phylogenetic patterns
5. Competition and community structure

## Types of Competition

## 1. Interference/exploitation Competition
* **Exploitation (indirect)**: reduces supply of shared resource.
	* Use of resource by one limits resource available to competitor
	* This is more common.
* **Interference (direct)**: species compete directly for shared resources through **aggression** ⟶ less common
	* E.g. African wild dogs face competition with lions, and adjust their spatial and temporal activities in response to lions. Wild dogs avoid lions; active when lions are not and occupy habitats with inferior prey density but lower lion abundance.
	* E.g. Plants compete for light, nutrients, space
		* vertical growth to promote competitive dominance
		* shade tolerance, maximizing performance under shade
		* lateral growth to avoid competition

### Invasive Species
* Competition from invasive species often decline abundances and local extinctions of native species
* It’s possible for some natives to co-exist with invasives, suggesting adaptive evolutionary responses
* **Experimental design of invasive-native competition:**
	* Compare two conspecific groups of native plants for differences in expression of growth/reproductive traits:
	* Populations that experienced competition from invasives (i.e., experienced natives) vs. populations with no known history of interactions with invasives (i.e., naive natives).
	* **Result:** Experienced natives had higher growth/reproduction than naive natives, when grown w/ w/o competition from invasive plants.

## 2. Intensity of Competition
* If resources are more scarce, competition increase in intensity

## 3. Symmetry of Competition

## 4. Competition among Distant Relatives (phylogenetic)

## 5. Competition and Community Structure
* Answer depends on whether species have similar competitive abilities or contain competitive hierarchies
* **Competitive hierarchy:** some species are better competitors than others.
* Competitive ability can be ranked
	* E.g., a community with four species (A, B, C, and D) can be ranked as: A > B > C > D

# Do Species Compete or Coexist?
## 1. Competitive Exclusion Principle
* Species that compete for same resources cannot coexist
