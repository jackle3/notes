# Parallel Evolution
* Unrelated organisms sometimes share very similar traits, caused by adapting to physical environments.

* The relatives of the cactus looks very different from cactus, and the relative of euphorb also looks very different.

# Main features of physical environment

## Conditions
* **Conditions:** physical factors that affect organismal growth
* Examples include: temperature, pH, salinity, humidity

## Resources
* **Resources:** all things consumed by an organism (biotic or abiotic)
	* Because resources can be locally depleted, organisms compete for resources.
* Examples include: sunlight, water, phosphate, acorns, nesting sites

# Response to environmental variation
* The physical environment influences an organism’s ecological success in two ways:
	* Availability of energy and resources—impacts **growth and reproduction.**
	* Extreme conditions can exceed tolerance limits and impact **survival**.

## Reaction Norm Plot
* The top line is reproduction, middle is individual growth, and bottom is individual survival.

* The plots need not be bell curve shaped.

# Coping with stress for plants
* Organisms deal with stress by **Tolerance** or **Avoidance**
* Plants are sessile (immobile) so must cope with range of variation in the environment they encounter in a place
	* Plants have evolved many adaptations for coping with stress from variation in temperature and water availability.
* The physiological traits of plants are a good indicator of climate.

## Temperature Balance
* Leaves have temperature balance, which can be captured by the following equation:
$$\Delta H_{plant} = SR + IR_{in} - IR_{out} \pm H_{conv} \pm H_{cond} - H_{et}$$
* Where:
	* delta H is the change in heat/temperature in the plant
	* SR is solar radiation
	* IR is infrared radiation
	* H_conv is convective heat transfer
	* H_cond is conductive heat transfer
	* H_et is heat transfer by evapotranspiration

## Solar Radiation
* To adjust **solar radiation** in the leaf, they can:
	- Adjust reflectance
		* Plants may develop a **silvery look or an exterior hair layer** to increase reflectance of solar radiation.
			* As hair layer thickness, leaf absorptance decreases.
			* Plants have been observed to increase or decrease hair layer thickness depending on season -- adaptation.
		* Plants can also **increase angle of incidence of light**.
			* During night, the leaves spread out horizontally to receive more light. 
			* During day, the leaves move up to near vertical to minimize light.
	- Adjust interception

## Convective Heat Transfer
![500](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241008110125.png)
* If leaf temp > air temp heat can be lost through conduction & convection
	* In many environments, convection can be the dominant form of heat loss
* **Boundary layer** (BL) is a layer of turbulent (or slow moving) air near the leaf surface
	* BL thickness controlled by leaf surface roughness & leaf size
	* Boundary layer increases with leaf diameter![400](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241008110215.png)
	* Small, smooth leaves have **thin boundary layers** and **cool more effectively** than large, rough leaves.

## Evapotransporation

* Stomata are specialized openings that allow plants to exchange gases with the environment
* Evapotranspirative cooling comes from energy lost due to phase change of water
* Trade-offs with stomatal opening


# Coping with stress for animals
* Animals also have optimal temperatures for their growth and development
* Same heat balance equation can be used for animals with additional term for metabolic heat production

* The thermoneutral zones and lower critical temperatures of endotherms vary with their habitats
![Pasted image 20241008111939](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241008111939.png)

* Animals have many behavioral and physiological mechanisms for dealing with temperature (fur, fat, etc..)

## Body size
* **Body size** is one the most informative traits to characterize organisms
	* Influences resource requirements (metabolism), dispersal capacity, reproductive and evolutionary rates, interactions with other species.
* There is a strong power relationship between body size and metabolism
![Pasted image 20241008112029](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241008112029.png)

* **Relative** metabolic rate inversely correlated with body size
	* Small organisms have > metabolic rate per gram of tissue
	* Small animals have larger relative heat loss, need more food to maintain temperature

* Larger species have **lower surface-to-volume** ratios, which minimizes heat loss and reduces metabolic cost of maintaining internal temperatures
* **Bergmann's Rule**: within a clade, body size will increase in colder climates and decrease in warmer climates
	* E.g. polar bears are bigger than bears in warmer climates.

* Body size often strongly correlated with resource use

## Additional stress adaptations
* stress responses may change overtime (through evolution or plasticity)
* acclimation is the ability to adjust physiology to reduce effects of environmental stress
* pre-exposure to stressful conditions may acclimate organisms to future stressors

**Corals example:**
 * stress response (bleaching) of Acropora corals growing in hot or cold pools
 * Corals grown in highly variable pools (extreme temperature change) were better able to tolerate simulated bleaching events in the lab
 * found that corals native to highly variable pools are acclimated to those stressful conditions already

# Niche Concept
* **Habitat** = where a species lives
* **Niche** = Summary of the conditions necessary for a species to practice it’s way of life

## Distributions reflect niche properties

## Fundamental vs Realized Niche
![Pasted image 20241008113105](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241008113105.png)

* Biotic interactions can really shrink the realized niche of a specific species.

# Summary

# Review: Niche
* Ecological niche characterizes the position of a species within an ecosystem, comprising species habitat requirements as well as its functional role.
* Environmental gradients (features) can be environmental conditions (pH, temps) or resources.
![Pasted image 20241010110922](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241010110922.png)
* Fundamental is the total range tolerated based on environment — realized takes into account biotic factors (where species are actually found).
	* The fundamental niche > realized niche because of **biotic interactions** and **historical constraint** + **dispersal limitation**
