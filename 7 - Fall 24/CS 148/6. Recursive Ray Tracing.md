# Ray Tracing
* A shadow ray is cast to each light source, and the total contribution from **all unobscured light** is accumulated:

* Mirror-like **reflection** can also contribute to the color at an intersection point
* **Transparency** allows other objects to be seen through a surface, allowing those objects to contribute to the color as well.

## Scaling Coefficients

## Recursion
* $L_{\text{reflect}}$ and $L_{\text{transmit}}$ are treated in the same way that pixel color is treated — ray tracing

* A ray is **recursively** constructed for the **reflection direction** and intersected with scene geometry (just like what is done for camera rays through pixels)
	* The reflection ray displays the reflection of the image on mirrored surfaces.
	* The result is stored in $L_{\text{reflect}}$
* A ray is **recursively** constructed for the **transmission direction** and intersected with scene geometry (just like what is done for camera rays through pixels)
	* The transmission ray allows light to pass through the object.
	* The result is stored in $L_{\text{transmit}}$

* $L_{\text{reflect}}$ and $L_{\text{transmit}}$ depend on the color computed from the geometry that their rays intersected
	* Those intersection points have colors of their own, also computed via shadow rays, ambient and diffuse shading, and **additional reflection and transmission**
	* Thus, even more rays need to be recursively spawned

# Transmission/Refraction
* The angle of **incidence** and angle of **transmission** (or refraction) are related via **Snell's Law**:

## Total Internal Reflection
* **Total internal reflection** occurs when there is no transmitted ray; only reflection occurs

### Critical Angle

* This is why when you look from inside water to the outside air, at certain angles it just looks like a mirror — cannot see through the water's surface.

# Attenuation
* Light is absorbed and scattered as it travels through material
* This attenuates the amount of light traveling along a straight line
	* The amount of attenuation **depends on the distance traveled** (through the material)
	* Different colors (actually, different wavelengths) are attenuated at different rates
* Example:
	* Shallow water is clear (almost no attenuation)
	* Deeper water attenuates all the red light and looks bluish-green
	* Even deeper water attenuates all the green light too, and looks dark blue
	* Eventually, all the light attenuates, and the color ranges from blackish-blue to black

## Beer's Law
* Beer's Law describes how light is absorbed as it travels through a medium. It states that the intensity of light decreases exponentially as it passes through an absorbing medium.
