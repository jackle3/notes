# Why Triangles?
* Most digital geometries are built by lots of triangles.
![Pasted image 20241004140845](Pasted%20image%2020241004140845.png)

* Triangles are good because we can:
	* **Specialize/optimize** for just triangles
		* Optimize software, algorithms, and hardware (e.g. GPUs) for just triangles.
	* They have a lot of inherent benefits:
		* Complex objects are well-approximated using enough triangles (piecewise linear convergence)
		* Easy to break other polygons into triangles.
		* Triangles are guaranteed to be planar (all points on the same flat 2D surface)
		* Transformations only need to be applied to **triangles vertices** instead of entire plane.
		* Robust barycentric interpolation can be used to interpolate information stored on vertices to the interior of the triangle.

# OpenGL
* Blender uses OpenGL for real-time scanline rendering.
* **OpenGL** is a drawing API for 2D/3D graphics
	* Designed to be implemented mostly on hardware.
	* OpenGL Is highly optimized for triangles
* GPUs and consoles are highly optimized for the graphics geometry pipeline.

# Rasterization
* Definition: the process of converting a vector image into a raster image, which is made up of pixels or dots.
* Steps:
	1. Transform vertices of the triangle to screen space (with the matrix stack)
	2. Find all pixels inside the 2D screen space triangle
	3. Color those pixels with the RGB-color of the triangle.

# 2D Rays
* Given two points, compute a **directed edge vector** $$e = p_1 - p_0 = (x_1 - x_0, y_1 - y_0)$$
* Compute a **2D normal** equation to the edge. This normal doesn't need to be unit length.$$n = (y_1 - y_0, -(x_1 - x_0))$$
* This 2D normal is "rightward" with respect to the **2D ray direction** (going from $p_0$ to $p_1)$.
	* The leftward normal is $-n$.
* Any point $p$ lying on the **edge vector** has $(p - p_0) \cdot n = 0$.

* A 2D point is considered **inside a 2D triangle**, when it is **interior** to (to the left of) all 3 rays
* Vertex ordering matters: **backward facing triangles are not rendered**, since no points are to the left of all three rays

## Boundary cases
* Because backward facing triangles are not rendered, this also means that pixels lying on a triangle boundary with $(p - p_0) \cdot n = 0$ won't be rendered.
	* This can cause gaps if two triangles share an edge.
* This can be fixed by rendering pixel where $(p - p_0) \cdot n \leq 0$ but then adjacent triangles will try to render the same pixel.
	* This is inefficient and can cause artifacts.
* **Solution:** render points on the shared edge consistently, preferring one triangle over the other.
	* Notice that the edge normals **point in opposite directions** for adjacent triangles.

* In order to interpolate $z'$  from triangle vertices to pixel locations, we use **screen space barycentric weight interpolation**.
