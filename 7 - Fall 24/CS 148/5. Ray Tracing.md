# Constructing Rays
* For each pixel, create a ray and intersect it with objects in the scene.
	* The first intersection is used to determine a color for the pixel.
* The ray is calculated as$$
R(t) = A + (P - A)t
$$
	* where $A$ is the aperture and $P$ is the pixel location.
* The ray is defined by $t \in [0, \infty)$ although only $t \in [1, t_{far}]$ is inside the viewing frustum.
	* We care about the first intersection where $t \geq 1$

## Parallelization
* Ray tracing is a per-pixel operation (scanline rendering is a per-triangle operation)
* Ray tracing is inherently parallel (the **ray for each pixel is independent** of other pixels)
* Can utilize parallel CPUs/Clusters/GPUs to accelerate ray tracing significantly
	* Threading (e.g., Pthread, OpenMP) distributes rays across CPU cores
	* Message Passing Interface (MPI) distributes rays across CPUs on different machines (unshared memory)
	* OptiX/CUDA distributes rays on the GPU
* Memory coherency is important when distributing rays to various threads/processors
	* Assign spatially neighboring rays (passing through neighboring pixels) to the same core/processor
	* These rays tend to intersect with the same objects in the scene and thus tend to access the same memory
* For the sake of comparison: Scanline rendering, as a per triangle operation, is parallelized to handle **one triangle at a time** (usually on a GPU)

# Ray-Triangle Intersection
* Given the enormous number of triangles, many approaches have been implemented and tested in order to find whether a ray intersections with an object or not.

## Ray-Plane Intersection
* Option 1:  Triangles are contained in planes, so consider the **Ray-Plane intersection** first
	* A Ray-Plane intersection yields a point, and a subsequent test determines if that point lies inside the triangle

* Option 1A: Both the triangle and the point can be projected into 2D; then, the 2D triangle rasterization test (to the left of all 3 rays) can be used to determine “inside”
	* Can project into the xy, xz, yz plane by just dropping the z, y, x coordinates (respectively) from the triangle vertices and the point
	* Most robust to drop the coordinate with the largest component in the triangle’s normal (so that the projected triangle has maximal area)

* Option 1B: There is a fully 3D version of the 2D rasterization

## Ray-Triangle Intersection
* Option 2: Skip the Ray-Plane intersection and consider the **Ray-Triangle intersection** directly
	* This is similar to how ray tracing works for non-triangle geometry (ray tracers handle non-triangle geometry better than scanline rendering does)

## Spurious Self-Occlusion
* In some cases, the object might intersect with itself, leading it to incorrectly assume that is being occluded.
