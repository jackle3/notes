## Grading
* The weekly graded HWs are building blocks towards the final project, which is **a single ray-traced image**.
* You can have a partner for both the HW and final project.
* HW is assigned Tuesday and due the following Monday during the quiz.
* Grading is done via live demos to the CAs
	* Make sure you can answer questions abt all parts of the code, regardless of which parts you or your partner did

# Ray Tracing
* The introduction of ray tracing in 2019 significantly changed this course.
	* Basically the GPU version of scanline rendering.
* Scanline rendering is fast but does not give you a very good image; ray tracing gives you a much better image.

# Project Proposal
* Find a motivating image(s) and write a short Project Proposal (1 paragraph) explaining the goals for your project as motivated by the image.
* This can be handed in at any point during **the first 7 weeks** and can be iterated.
