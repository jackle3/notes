# Building a Virtual World
* The goal is to mimic human vision in a virtual world (with a computer)
* The steps to build a world are:
	1. Create a **virtual camera**; place it somewhere and point it at something
	2. Put film (i.e. pixels with RGB values in 0-255) into the camera
	3. Place objects in the world
		* This includes floor/ground, walls, ceiling/sky, etc
		* Two step process:
			* (1) make objects
			* (2) place objects (*transformations*)
		* Making objects involves
			* (1) build geometry (*geometric modeling*)
			* (2) paint geometry (*texture mapping*)
	4. Put lights into the scene.
	5. Finally, render the scene.
		* You use either scanline rendering or ray tracing to take the picture.

# Aperture
* Instead of cones, cameras have **mechanical pixel**
* Instead of a pupil (which restricts/allows entry of light), cameras have an **aperture**

# Pinhole Camera
* Light travels in a straight line through a pinhole to create an image on the other side.
	* Leads to objects that are further away being smaller.

## Virtual Camera
* Using the idea of a pinhole, we can put a camera in front of the pinhole.

## Distortion
* Camera distortion depends on distance.

# Objects
* Consider a single point in 3D $x = \begin{pmatrix}x & y & z\end{pmatrix}$ in the virtual world.
* Objects are a collection of points, so methods for handling a point extends to the entire object.
* Objects are created in a reference **object space**
* Once created, we can place the object into the scene (aka the **world space**)
	* This may require *rotation, translation, or resizing* of the object.
* When we take a picture, we **project the object onto the 2D plane** (aka the **screen space**)
	* This projection is nonlinear and can lead to distortions.

## Rotation

* Rotation **preserves line segments**, including the distance/length of the segment.

* Rotation also **preserves angles** between line segments.

* Rotation also **preserves shape**
