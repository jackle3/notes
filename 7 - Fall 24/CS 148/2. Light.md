# Light in Graphics
## Optics
* Light is **emitted** from a light source
* That emitted light impacts various objects, where it may be **reflected** or **absorbed**.
	* This reflection/absorption modifies the light (e.g. color, brightness, dullness, etc)
* In addition, light may **pass/transmit through** a material and be bent, scattered, etc.
	* e.g. prism, stained glass, water, etc

## Perception
* Some light enters your eyes creating a signal.
* Your brain creates an image based on the signals it gets from your eyes.
* We use human perception to **optimize/simplify** how we represent images.
	* We create images not to duplicate reality but to **fool humans into believing as such**.
	* This is why dogs can't really watch TV the same way we do; the images look different.

* When designing, **use white lights** to ensure the colors are right. Only at the end do you introduce different colored light sources.

## Adding Light
* The human eye perceives combinations of light energy.

## Absorbing and Reflecting Light
* The color of light after bouncing depends on the surface.

* Energy is conserved, hence why `reflected + absorbed = 1`

## Sensor Absorption
* Sensors absorb light and create a single signal -> can't differentiate between different kinds of light that well.

# Human Eye
* The eye has 3 types of cones and 1 rod. These are the sensors.
	* Cones are tuned for daylight, rods are tuned for nighttime.
	* Think of the cones as being each of RGB -> gives color.
	* Since only 1 rod, we basically see grayscale with the rods.
* At night, cones are under-saturated (low/noisy signal) and rods produce most the signal.
* During day, the rods are over-saturated (maxed out), so we see primarily with the cones.

* The graph on the left indicates that at some wavelength, the height is how much that signal is absorbed by that cone.

## Trichromatic Theory
* Given any **color**, you can mix the color from three single-wavelength lasers (R, G, B) to fool a human into thinking that the **lasers combine** to make the color.

## CMYK Color Space
* Printers use CMYK, a subtractive color space.
* The ink masks/absorbs colors on a white background, reducing the light.

**Additive Color Space**
* Superimposed colored lines (e.g. phone display)
	* You shine the lights onto a surface. Adding them together gets you white.
* Add spectra (wavelength by wavelength)
* R + G + B = white

**Subtractive Color Space**
* Usually means a sequence of color filers (e.g. ink or paint).
	* You filter out each color from the light. If you have all filters, it's black.
* We multiply all absorption coefficients (wavelength by wavelength)
* R + G + B = black

# Brightness (Luminance)
* The gray-scale image has much more spatial detail than the colored images.

![Pasted image 20240926202807](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240926202807.png)

* Because our eyes can see small changes in brightness, we need many levels of brightness.
	* Otherwise, changing brightness by small amounts will look discontinuous.
	* This is why the color channels have values from 0 to 255.

## Dynamic Range (Contrast Ratios)
* The contrast ratio effectively measures the range on the scale that it can show.

## Tone Mapping (for HDR)
* In HDR images, we have a much larger range for brightness, allowing us to effectively stack all the images below into one image.

* Raw images allocate more bits (less quantization) to lower intensities than higher intensities.
* To reverse this, we use gamma correction to get the original brightness/luminance.
