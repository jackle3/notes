# Requirements
![[Pasted image 20241107154700.png]]
* As long as the main focus on the screen is complex and made by you, then you will satisfy the first requirement.

## Ray Tracing

* The one below "fulfills" all the requirements, but it would get a bad grade because it does not look good.

* In this one, even though there is ray tracing, it's not what we want.
	* It has hard shadows, bad lighting, flat shading, etc.

# Photorealism

* Photorealism does not mean it needs to look real. It's the lighting and etc.

* This one is also great. The scene is simple, the donut is modeled based on a tutorial. But the power of ray tracing is very clear.

* For water textures, you can just use a glass BSDF texture because they're pretty similar.
