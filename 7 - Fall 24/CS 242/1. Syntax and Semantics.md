* **Syntax:** what is the structure of the expression
* **Static semantics:** what subset of expressions have meaning?
* **Dynamic semantics:** what is the meaning of a given expression?

# Syntax
* Syntax defines the set of allowable forms in our language, the structure of our domain
* **Primitives:** objects that represent atomic units of meaning. Examples are:
	* Arithmetic: numbers
	* Programming languages: chars, bools, functions
	* Natural languages: nouns, verbs, adjectives
* **Composition:** define structure over primitives ⟶ relates primitive objects together
	* In arithmetic, composition consists of binary operators that combine numbers.

## Syntax Trees
* Context free grammars describe tree structures.
	* E.g. the statement `1 + 2 * 3` in linear text implicitly describes the tree

* Languages have abstract and concrete syntax.
	* **Abstract syntax:** structureof the language
	* **Concrete syntax:** symbols in the language
* A language could have multiple concrete syntaxes for the same absttact syntax
	* A tree corresponding to a piece of syntax is called an abstract syntax tree (AST)

# Semantics
* Given a language that defines expressions, our goal is to define a semantics that can reduce an expression to a primitive form.
	* E.g. given `1 + 2 * 3`, reduce it to `7`
* Church languages are expression-oriented in that an entire program is a single expression, so a program represents a single value.
	* In the arithmetic language, any program (arithmetic expression) corresponds to a single number resulting from its computation.

## Operational Semantics
* We define a formal notion of computation for expression languages through a small-step operational semantics.
* For any given expression $e$, it can be in one of two states:
	* **reducible** ⟶ meaning a computation can be performed
		* we denote this as $e ⟶ e'$ for "$e$ steps to $e'$"
	* **value** ⟶ the expression has reached its final form.
		* we denote this as $e \text{ val}$ for "$e$ is a value"
* Below is the complete operational semantics for arithmetic.

* The D-num rule establishes a termination condition for arithmetic programs: once we’re reached a number $n$, that’s value so we’re done.
* The D-Left rule says if the left side can be reduced, then reduce it.
* The D-Right rule says that if the left side cannot be reduced and the right side can, then reduce the right side.
* The D-$\oplus$ rule says, when we have a binary operator $\hat{\oplus}$ with two subexpressions that are both numbers, then perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
### Term Reduction Proof
* https://stanford-cs242.github.io/f19/lectures/01-2-syntax-semantics#term-reduction-proof
## Structural Induction
* Used to prove universal statements about all possible programs
* Based on the structure of the language:
	* Base case: primitives (numbers)
	* Inductive case: compositions of sub-expressions
* Derived from Peano numerals concept:
	* Numbers defined as: $\text{Number } n ::= Z \mid S(n)$
	* $Z$ is zero, $S(n)$ is successor (+1)

### Induction Principles
* For arithmetic expressions: $e ::= n \mid e_1 \hat{\oplus} e_2$
$$
(\forall e.\, P(e)) \iff \left((\forall n.\, P(n)) \land (\forall e_1, e_2, \oplus^ .\, P(e_1) \land P(e_2) \implies P(e_1 \hat{\oplus} e_2))\right)
$$
* Proposition $\forall e. P(e)$ is true for all expressions if:
	* Unconditionally true for all numbers (base case)
	* Conditionally true for composite expressions when true for sub-expressions (inductive case)

## Totality in Arithmetic
* **Definition:** All programs in our language are total/terminating
* This means every program:
	* Always evaluates to a value
	* Never gets stuck
	* Never raises an error
	* Never loops forever
* **Formal statement:** For all expressions $e$, there exists an $e'$ where:
	* $e \mapsto^* e'$ ($e$ reduces to $e'$)
	* $e' \text{ val}$ ($e'$ is a value)
