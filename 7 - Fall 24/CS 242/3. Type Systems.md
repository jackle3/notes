## Untyped Systems
* In untyped lambda calculus, we could create programs with undefined behaviors
	* E.g. programs that evaluate to stuck states by having free variables
$$
(\lambda x. \; x)\;y \tag{this evaluates to stuck state}
$$
* We also couldn't easily enforce higher-level constraints about our functions.
	* E.g. consider a function that applies an argument $x$ twice to a function $f$$$
	\lambda f . \lambda x . f\;(x\;x)
	$$
	* We could accidentially provide a function $f$ that only takes one argument.
$$
\begin{align*}
&((\lambda f . \lambda x . f\;(x\;x))\;(\lambda y . y)) \\
& \rightarrow (\lambda x . ((\lambda y . y)\;x\;x)) \\
& \rightarrow (\lambda x . (x\;x)) \\
\end{align*}
$$
	* Ideally, we want to restrict the allowable values for $f$ to the set of ƒunctions with two arguments.
$$
f= \lambda x . \lambda y . x\;y
$$
# Invariants
* The desired properties above are all examples of invariants, or program properties that should always hold true. Other examples include:

* There are three main considerations in the designs of invariants:
![[Pasted image 20241220141840.png]]
* E.g. `assert` is a type of invariant in Python.
	* Structure ⟶ the language of invariants is Python expressions
	* Inference ⟶ there is no inference; you have to write assert statements yourself
	* Time of check ⟶ asserts are checked at runtime.
```python
def div(m, n):
	assert(type(m) == int and type(n) == int)
	assert(n != 0)
	return m / n
```

## Type Systems
* Language ⟶ language of invariants is restricted.
	* Types specify that a variable of a "kind" of thing (e.g. int, string, etc)
	* But they cannot specify conditions like `n != 0`
* Inference ⟶ languages increasingly use type inference (via `let`, etc) to infer types
* Time of check ⟶ types can be checked ahead of time (statically) or during program execution (dynamically)

# Typed Lambda Calculus
* First, we introduce a language of types indicated by the variable $\tau$
	* A type is either a number or a function from input type $\tau_1$ to $\tau_2$.
* Then we extend our untyped lambda calculus with the same arithmetic language from before.

* Usage of the language is similar to before.
![[Pasted image 20241220142606.png]]
* The operational semantics are also the same as before.
![[Pasted image 20241220142617.png]]
* The examples almost translate directly to OCaml.

## Type System Goals
* If a program is well-defined, it should never enter a struck state after each step.
* The goal of a type system is to provide a definition of “well-defined” such that we can prove whether a given program is well-defined without executing it
> [!NOTE] Type safety theorem (strict)
>  For all expressions $e$, if $e : \tau$ ($e$ has type $\tau$), then $\exists e'$ such that $e \stackrel{*}{\mapsto} e'$ and $e' \text{ val}$
* This theorem applies to programs that are total (e.g. they terminate). To reason about programs that do not terminate (e.g. infinite loops), we can decompose it as:

> [!NOTE] Type safety (decomposed)
> 1. **Progress**: if $e : \tau$ then either $e \text{ val}$ or $\exists e'$ such that $e \stackrel{*}{\mapsto} e'$
> 	* If an expression is well-typed and is not a value, then we should be able to step the expression (i.e. it is not in a stuck state)
> 2. **Preservation**: if $e : \tau$ and $e \mapsto e'$, then $e' : \tau$
> 	   * If an expression is well-typed, when it steps, the type is preserved.

* These two theorems are sufficient to prove that a well-typed expression will never enter a stuck state at any point during its execution.

## Static Semantics
* We need to define how we determine the type of an expression.
* For numbers, it is:
![[Pasted image 20241220143747.png]]
* This is quite similar to our operation semantics (or "dynamic semantics"). Each rule defines a way to determine whether an expression has a particular type.
	* T-Num ⟶ a numeric constant $n$ has type $\text{num}$ under all conditions.
	* T-Binop ⟶ if two subexpressions are both numbers. then the binop on those is also a number.
* The proff for checking $(1 + 2 - 3) : \text{num}$ is:
![[Pasted image 20241220143948.png]]
* The formal rules for applying types is:
	* T-Var ⟶ if our context says $x : \tau \in \Gamma$ then $x$ has type $\tau$.
	* T-Lam ⟶ to type check a function, we want to type-check the body of the function $e$ assuming that $x : \tau_\text{arg}$, where $\tau_\text{arg}$ is the type provided in the program syntax.
		* Then, if our body typechecks to another type $\tau_\text{ret}$, this becomes the return type of the function, meaning the type of the function is $\tau_\text{arg} \rightarrow \tau_\text{ret}$
	* T-App ⟶ when calling a function, if the function $e_\text{lam}$ is typed $\tau_\text{arg} \rightarrow \tau_\text{ret}$, and the argument expression $e_\text{arg}$ is typed $\tau_\text{arg}$
		* Then, the result of applying the function is typed $\tau_\text{ret}$.
