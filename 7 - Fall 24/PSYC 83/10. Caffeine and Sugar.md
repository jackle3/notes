# Caffeine
* Similar to cocaine and meth, caffeine and sugar are forms of stimulants.
* For the average American, the FDA says you should not consume more than 400mg of caffeine per day.
* Completely absorbed in the blood 30-60 min and goes right into the brain
	* Metabolized in 2 to 12 hours (on average 4 to 6 hours)
	* Average American consumes 300mg of caffeine per day
* Caffeine inhibits Adenosine (A1, A2) receptors
	* Adenosine modulates DA and Glu in the NAcc ⟶ caffine **increases dopamine and glutamate**
	* Adenosine Receptors and Their Role:
		* Adenosine is a neuromodulator that generally promotes sleep and relaxation in the brain. It does so by binding to its receptors, A1 and A2A.
		* When adenosine binds to A1 receptors, it usually reduces neuronal activity, leading to calming effects.
		* A2A receptors are closely linked to dopamine (DA) receptors in areas like the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a part of the brain involved in reward and pleasure.
	* Caffeine's Action:
		* Caffeine inhibits (blocks) the A1 and A2A receptors, meaning it prevents adenosine from binding to them.
		* When adenosine is blocked, its calming influence is reduced, leading to increased neuronal activity and a feeling of alertness.
	* Impact on Dopamine (DA) and Glutamate (Glu):
		* By blocking A2A receptors in the NAcc, caffeine indirectly influences dopamine (DA) and glutamate (Glu) activity.
		* Dopamine is associated with motivation and reward, and glutamate is a primary excitatory neurotransmitter. Adenosine normally modulates (inhibits) dopamine release.
		* When caffeine blocks A2A receptors, it can enhance dopamine signaling in this brain region, contributing to the stimulating and mood-elevating effects of caffeine.
		* It also can increase glutamate release, further contributing to heightened alertness and arousal.

**Motor Activity Following Caffeine Injection (in mice)**
* Saline solutions had pretty low activity ⟶ 1000 counts / 60 min
* 3mg of caffeine increased activity slightly ⟶ 2000 counts / 60 min
* 10 mg increased it quite a bit ⟶ 7000 counts / 60 min
* 30mg slightly increased it further ⟶ 7500 counts / 60 min
* 100mg had little effect ⟶ 1100 counts / 60 min

* At high concentrations of caffeine, calcium gets angry ⟶ calcium gets released in areas that we aren't used to.

* **Caffeine has almost the same dopamine curve (including the spike) as cocaine and nicotine**
	* Though need to be careful when comparing because

## Other Effects of Caffeine
* It is a vasoconstrictor ⟶ can increase blood pressure
* It increases acid secretion in the stomach (drinking on empty stomach can cause nausea)
* Increase in metabolism
	* Increase in lipolysis
	* Decrease in glucose uptake
	* Increase in hepatic glucose production
* Increases urine output ⟶ makes you feel dehydrated (peeing more than you normally would)
* Increases shortness of breath
* Increases wakefulness ⟶ adenosine receptor antagonism

## Prop 65
* If something is a carcinogen, you need to put up warnings.
* The roasting of coffee beans produces chemicals called acrylamides, which are carcinogenic and can be harmful to your health.
	* Although there are carcinogens in almost everything these days.

# WHO
* "The substance use disorders include caffeine use disorder and caffeine dependence"
# APA
* Recognizes caffeine as a condition for further study
* Though they recognize that caffeine withdrawal is a medical condition

# Is Caffeine Addictive?
* YES:
	* Reward system activation
	* Withdrawal symptoms (though not nearly as bad as alcohol, etc)
	* Carvings
	* Tolerance
* NO:
	* Long term negative consequences
	* Less dopamine than illicit drugs
	* Easier to give up
	* Mice don't show addiction symptoms
