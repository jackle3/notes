* Start the meeting with a serenity prayer
* Read out traditions of the AA big book
	* The only requirement for AA is the desire to stop drinking
	* AA has no opinion on outside issues — AA name will never be drawn to public controveresy
	* Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions.

* Greeting: i'm [name], an alcoholic

* **How it works**
	* those who cannot recover are those who cannot or will not give themselves to the program
	* they are not at fault, they may have been form that way. they are capable of grasping and living a life of honesty
	* many do recovery if they have the capacity to be honest

* Then they went to ask people with under 30 days of sobrierty
	* not to shame but to welcome them home
	* matthew had 3 day sobriety — meeting host responded with "welcome back welcome home"

* Then asked for birthdays or milestones (people could speak or type in chat)
	* joe — celebrating 18 years of sobrierty
	* nirav — celeberating 211 days sober
	* orbalina with 9 months
	* brandy p with 8 months
	* avila with 6 months

* host asked people if they were willing to be a sponsor for others, help them with their path to sobriety

* picked an attendee to start them off. called on a person but they didn't respond.
	* called on a different person, jennie. asked them to pick a number. they picked 46.
	* the quote was **"stay in the solution, not the problem"** ⟶ this is the meeting topic

* jennie discusses her thoughts about the quote.
	* she's gotten a little better about that. staying in the solution, she was coming into AA knowing that "oh i've got problems, but lets talk about them"
	* take a problem, topic, and talk about it with others
	* one person she knew had a lot of sobrierty (30 years) ⟶ instead of talking about the problem and all the stuff, got straight to talking about the solution instead of the problem and its symptoms
	* don't have to dig much around there in the archives (resentments against others, etc) to make breakthroughs ⟶ let go of resentments, focusing on and get to the solution
		* get rid of the problem, stay in the solution

* she then picked someone else. picked allison.
	* hi im allison, im an alcoholic, thank you for calling on me. happy to be here today. and matthew we're glad that you're back.
	* having a lot of issues with sisters and dad ⟶ getting on my nerves, building a resentment against them.
		* she's been praying about it ⟶ the book says to pray for the person for two weeks every day
		* praying that god gives her piece to forgive and to let go of the resentment
			* the fact that they don't agree is okay with her, but maybe not with them
			* she can only clean her side of the street, and that's what she'll do
	* clean slate, agree to disagree. believe that we are all doing what is bet.
	* staying in the solution (to keep praying about it and to be there for her dad), instead of the problem (issues with sisters)

* then called on vinnie.
	* when you come into the room, share the message not the mess
	* this is what this reminds him
		* stay in the solution, stick to the big book and the 12-12 (the solution)
			* once we start doing this, the mess (the problem) kind of fades into the background. we're focusing on and looking for the solution instead of looking at the problem.
	* the solution is right here at AA ⟶ people come in to share stories. get together with sponsor and read the big book.
		* one step at a time.
	* "we'll love you until you love yourself"
		* when people come into AA, they don't really like much about themselves ⟶ they don't like that they're an alcoholic
		* when people come into AA, they see others that begin to love themselves ⟶ this is the solution, this is possible for them to reach; keep coming back, don't give up.
	* just wait for the miracle

* Then called on Anne
	* staying the solution is a great idea
	* there are 44 participants in this zoom meeting ⟶ this is a record
		* the solution that this meeting is bringing for people is growing
		* people start having wonderful experiences and feel accompanied and valued
	* the big part of the solution is that AA gives people possibililty and hope and so much, demonstrated by all the members at the AA meeting
		* there are also practical solutions too ⟶ very valuable to purchase a couple book
			* the twelve steps and twelve traditions (the 12 by 12)
			* the big book (alcoholics anonymous book)
		* terminal disease that wants you dead, but it comes with a manual to get over it
			* alcoholism is a disease! it would be so happy if we simply took the first drink.
			* take the disease and its consequences very seriously

* then called on David P
	* staying in the solution. it was easy to accept because he had no idea except that he wanted to quit.
	* in time, he got to understand that the solution was the meetings and the books
		* if you go, you'll do better ⟶ that's part of the solution

* then called on David B
	* told me when he came into the rooms that if nothing changes, then nothing changes
	* didn't quite know how he was going to get into the solution, except that he needed to get a sponsor and needed to go to 90 meetings.
		* needed to work with the sponsor to take the stesp that were on the wall
		* the steps overwhelmed him, and all he wanted to do was whine and complain and play the victim and talk about how the world had been so cruel
			* he was such a nice guy, how did he deserve to be an alcoholic ⟶ thought alcoholism was a curse
	* he didn't realize until he acknowledged that he was not special, just another drunk.
	* he needed to get out of the problem and get into the solution
		* take the 12 steps, and work on sobriety


* Then called on Amy
	* stay in the solution and not the problem ⟶ means a couple of different things
	* when early in sobriety, staying in the solution means staying away from drinking
		* that was the main solution at that time.
		* not an easy thing to do at any time for an alcoholic
	* as she understood the program more, the solution was really about working the program
		* the step towards the solution is working the program, attending meetings, being in the book and working through the book's twelve steps, working through those with a sponsor
		* being proactive in obtaining a solution
	* the solution is a spiritual awakening
		* might sound weird if you're just coming up, but based on the fact that alcoholism is a spiritual, mental, and physical disease.
			* many mistakenly think that alcoholism is just a physical disease ⟶ its not, it's much more complex that includes both mental and spirutual components
		* coming into the program, she was **not spiritual or religious**
			* helped her get to a place where what she interpreted as a solution, which was a spiritual awakening
	* alcoholism is the problem ⟶ its a disease that everyone in the room has in common
		* everyone understands it to a different degree
		* staying in the solution means to keep coming back, and that it'll work if you keep working it

* then called on daniel
	* [todo]
	* need to start acting his age ⟶ running his own lane and his own race to better his own sobriety and emotions **today**
		* yesterday is gone, tomorrow is not promised
	* in a calm state, happy to be here and be part of this group.

* then called on Danny H
	* picking up the cellphone is the best solution
		* need to start doing it more, put it down for a while and it got too heavy
		* getting in touch with sponsee brothers and people in recovery
		* don't just use his own thoughts, reach out to others and listen to their advice


* then called on Nirav
	* hes been staying in the solution, doing about three zoom meetings a day
	* just a trip because hes the person that used to drink a lot every day
	* joining the zoom meetings because he needed help
	* called a fellow alcoholic and got advice
		* they said meetings are good, but the steps are good too
			* write down your resentments, start doing some work
		* he's currently on his fourth step
	* by continuing to work through the steps, he'll be in the solution
	* stop the poor poor me and do the 12 steps with a sponsor

* then called on Jim
	* involves four people, three of which were together fairly frequently and one of them starts crying when two of them starts fighting
	* he said "well, if I don't participate in the fight, maybe she will stop crying"
		* his incentive to do this came from things he picked up by coming to more meetings
		* not only did that work, there hasn't been a quarrel in weeks since he started this
	* he's been more consistent in his **spirituality** part of the program

* Then called on Christine
	* grateful for this topic because she used to stay in the pollution (the problem) and not the solution
	* she's still trying to run her own program, but she was hanging out with the crowd that just wanted to get their court card signed ⟶ people who were not really into the solution
	* she's grateful that she lives in the solution now
		* working with others keeps her in the solution, in the books/literature, close contact with god and her sponsor and a group of true friends who are all in the solution
		* surrounded herself with people who wants to live, wants to recovery from alcoholism
	* she now has a positive outlook on life because she's now in the solution
		* fully live in the twelve steps
		* she's close to making it to 6 years of honest sobriety
		* honest, openminded, and willingness to stay in the solution and stay away from the pollution

* then called on Avila
	* this is his first zoom meeting
	* he's been clean for about 5 or 6 months now, but mainly because of jail
	* he's still trying to figure out what the solution is
		* 50 years old and he spent a lot of his time locked in
	* he's sober and clean now, feels good
	* he's trying, taking it day by day and fighting the urges
	* going to meetings and hoping that it gets him through the urges
	* planning on staying clean, trying to figure out

* then called on Andres
	* the solution is always going to be different for everybody
		* some people use the program and use others to help themselves out
		* some people alternate to different activities
	* for him, his solution is to always stay busy
		* loves driving cars, motorcycles, and fixing them
		* it's always been his solution
		* after he ended up getting pulled over ⟶ ended up purchasing a vehicle that he can take apart and fix
		* he also works two jobs on top of that
			* these fills up his time ⟶ leaves him no desire to drink, do drugs, etc
		* he also works with kids
			* it's helpful to hear how great hes doing, hear appreciation from people for helping them and for how hes doing
	* the solution is what you come to find, but if you keep working at it and search it'll always come through for you

* Then called on Matthew
	* maybe there's no such thing as a solution without a problem
	* today, he's 3-4 days sober ⟶ he got a sponsor a few days ago
	* committed to AA and to make sobrierty
		* wasn't very impressed by his sponsor
	* victomhood ⟶ some of us have been abused; we should be out of that and we shouldn't live in sorrow
	* part of the four steps is to figure out what happens to you; need to figure out what you need to do
	* his dad died last month and he took care of him for two years ⟶ it was very hard for him when his dad didn't write a will
		* he was able to get through a lot business while drunk
	* today, his sponsor gave him an assignment and he finished the first step
		* he let his sponsor know that he doesn't have insurance, and can't drive anywhere.
		* the sponsor says "you are not expressing your greatest length"
		* he doesn't like his sponsor
	* he's going to pray for his sponsor to treat others better
		* if newcomes are the most important, they shouldn't be treated like crap by his sponsor.
		* when he becomes a sponsor, he will care about his sponsee and learn about his sponsee.
		* sponsors shouldn't be sending sponsees to drive to meetings without insurance and having them arrested

* Then called on Renee
	* reads out a chapter of the book
		* we have discovered common solution on which we can agree and join brotherly for a common action
	* how to stay through action?

		* will try to practice that as much as he can

* then called on Cathy
	* every morning when she wakes, a part of her solution is to not take that first drink.
		* she needs to wake up and know that she's not going to do that.
		* how? it's because she wants her sobriety
	* had a talk with sponsor, talking about relapse and recovery
		* she had like 30 year sobriety but relapsed some day
		* for the last 11 years, she was out there in the disease; could only get short periods of sobriety ⟶ always kept relapsing
		* had a fear of the word relapsing and going back to drinking
			* it's okay to have this fear
		* she knows that says **relapse is a part of recovery**
			* sponsor said "i didn't know you would make it back"
			* don't drink, call your sponsor, read the big book, and hang with like-minded people. it works.
	* trying to cling on to keeping her sobriety together


* Ends the meeting with **reading the promises**
	* we will not regret the past nor will we shut the door on it
	* we will comprehend the word serenity and know peace
	* that feeling of uselessness and self pity will disappear
	* we will lose interest in selfish things
	* fear and insecurities will leave us
	* we will suddenly realize that god is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves
	* these are not extravagant promises ⟶ they are being fulfilled, sometimes quickly sometimes slowly

* Then they close the meeting with the **serenity prayer**
	* God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
	* Courage to change the things I can
	* And wisdom to know the difference
