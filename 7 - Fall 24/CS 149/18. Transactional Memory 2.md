# Transactional Memory Review
* Goal: raise the level of abstraction for synchronization to the level of thinking of atomic regions of the program that execute as an isolated sequence of memory operations.

## Advantages
![Pasted image 20241209200311](Pasted%20image%2020241209200311.png)
* Transaction will only serialize if there are conflicts ⟶ can be massively parallelized.
## Implementation Basics

# Transaction Memory Examples
* The scheme closest to conventional memory coherence is **eager + pessimistic**
* With software TM systems, we can have special behaviors with reads and writes.
![Pasted image 20241209165923](Pasted%20image%2020241209165923.png)

# Software TM
* In software, we put **software barriers like locks** in order to implement the TM system.
	* Below is an example of atomic in TM code.

### Runtime Data Structures
The STM needs two main data structures for its implementation

**Transaction descriptor (per-thread)**
* Used for conflict detection, commit, abort, …
* Includes the read set, write set, undo log or write buffer

**Transaction record (per data)**
* Pointer-sized record guarding shared data
* Tracks the transactional state of the data (shared or exclusive mode)
	* Shared: accessed by multiple readers
		* Using version number or shared reader lock
	* Exclusive: access by one writer
		* Using writer lock that points to owner
	* This is the same way that HW cache coherence works

### Mapping Data to Transaction Records
* Using too coarse a granularity for conflict detection might lead to detecting conflicts that don't actually exist (similar to false sharing)

### Conflict Detection Granularity
* At the level of object granularity, these transactions conflict.
* At the level of element/field granularity, these transactions do not conflict.

## Example: Intel McRT STM
> [! Properties of McRT]
> * **Eager versioning** ⟶ immediately write to memory as soon as transaction writes.
> * **Optimistic Reads**:
>     * Reads are performed without acquiring locks.
>     * This assumes that data won't be modified concurrently, leading to higher performance for read-heavy workloads.
>     * However, there’s a risk of reading stale or inconsistent data.
> * **Pessimistic Writes**:
>     * Writes are protected with locks to ensure consistency.
>     * This prevents multiple transactions from writing to the same data simultaneously, avoiding conflicts.

### Descriptor and Record
* **Transaction descriptor:** Uses timestamp for version tracking
	* Global timestamp ⟶ Incremented when a writing xaction commits
	* Local timestamp per xaction ⟶ Global timestamp value when xaction last validated
* **Transaction record** (32-bit)
	* Least significant bit:
		* 0 if data is writer-locked (exclusive)
		* 1 if data is not locked (shared)
	* Most significant bits
		* If not locked, stores timestamp (version number) of last commit
		* If locked, stores pointer to owner transaction

### STM Operations
**STM Read (optimistic)**
1. Direct read from memory location (because its eager versioning)
2. First, validate data that you're reading
	* Check if data is unlocked and data's version ≤ local timestamp
		* I.e. no one has modified since you last validated
	* If not, validate all data in read set for consistency (see below)
		* If need to retry, roll back all writes and give up write locks
1. Then, insert in read set
2. Then, return value

**STM Write (pessimistic)**
1. Validate data
	* Check if unlocked and data version ≤ local timestamp
	* If not, roll back all writes (bc eager), give up write locks, and retry
1. Acquire the write lock on data
2. Insert in write set
3. Create undo log entry
4. Write data into memory (eager)

**Read-set validation**
1. Get global timestamp
2. For each item in the read set
	* If locked by others, or data version > local timestamp, then conflict ⟶ abort
3. Set local timestamp to global timetsamp from initial step

**STM Commit**
1. Atomically increment global timestamp by 2
	* Increment by 2 because we want to update *second least* significant bit (recall the last significant bit is used for the lock)
2. If pre-incremented (old) global timestamp > local timestamp, validate read-set
	* This is to check for recently committed transactions
3. For each item in the write set
	* Release the lock and update version number to global timestamp

### Example
![Pasted image 20241209202116](Pasted%20image%2020241209202116.png)

**Initial Transaction Record (per data)**
* Suppose `foo` and `bar` are both unlocked ⟶ stores version number.
	* `foo` was last committed in time 3
	* `bar` was last committed in time 5

* Suppose line 1 of X1 and line 1 of X2 ran. The read sets would be:
	* `<foo, 3>` means we read the `foo` object, which was last committed at `3`.
![Pasted image 20241209203831](Pasted%20image%2020241209203831.png)
* When line 2 of X1 runs (`bar.x = t`):
	* We need to acquire lock on bar ⟶ change record to X1
	* We write to memory, and update the undo log.
![Pasted image 20241209203940](Pasted%20image%2020241209203940.png)
* When line 2 of X2 runs (`t1 = bar.x`):
	* It sees that X1 has the lock for `bar`
	* If following STM exactly, we would abort. However, this is a read after write, so we can just X2 stall.
* When line 4 of X1 runs (`bar.y = t` where `t = foo.y`)
	* Write to memory and update the undo log.
![Pasted image 20241209204841](Pasted%20image%2020241209204841.png)
* When X1 commits:
	* It checks its read set ⟶ `<foo, 3>` in read set, and `foo` still has 3 in its version number, so read set is up to date.
	* The commit updates the time stamp in `bar` to `7`.
![Pasted image 20241209205137](Pasted%20image%2020241209205137.png)
![Pasted image 20241209205144](Pasted%20image%2020241209205144.png)
* When X2 reads `bar` again:
	* It will put `bar, 7` in its read set.
* When X2 tries to commit:
	* It will abort because one of its read set items has `bar, 5`.

### Summary
![Pasted image 20241209205402](Pasted%20image%2020241209205402.png)

## Disadvantages of STM
* STM has significant per-thread overhead due to barriers, especially during reads.
* There is also a lack of strong atomicity because it's hard to provide that purely via software.
* In single-threaded systems, STM can be 5x+ slowdown over sequential

# Hardware TM
![Pasted image 20241209205911](Pasted%20image%2020241209205911.png)

**Data versioning is implemented in caches**
* Cache the write buffer or the undo log
* Add new cache line metadata to track transaction read set and write set

**Conflict detection through cache coherence protocol**
* Coherence lookups detect conflicts between transactions
* Works with snooping and directory coherence

**Note:**
* With hardware TM, we must also have a checkpoint of registers at transaction begin (to restore execution context state on abort)

## HTM Design
**Add annotations to cache lines to track read set and write set**
* `R/W` bits can be at word or cache-line granularity
	* `R` bit: indicates data read by transaction (set on loads)
	* `W` bit: indicates data written by transaction (set on stores)
* `R/W` bits gang-cleared on transaction commit or abort
![Pasted image 20241209210158](Pasted%20image%2020241209210158.png)

**Coherence requests check `R/W` bits to detect conflicts**
* Observing shared request to `W`-word is a read-write conflict
* Observing exclusive (intent to write) request to R-word is a write-read conflict
* Observing exclusive (intent to write) request to W-word is a write-write conflict

## Example Implementation: Lazy-Optimistic
**CPU changes**
* Ability to checkpoint register state (available in many CPUs) in case of abort
* TM state registers (status, pointers to abort handlers, …)
**Cache changes**
* `R` bit indicates membership to read set
* `W` bit indicates membership to write set
* The rest of the bits in line are: `D` (dirty bit) and `V` (valid bit), used for coherence
![Pasted image 20241209210334](Pasted%20image%2020241209210334.png)

**Transaction Begin**
![Pasted image 20241209210359](Pasted%20image%2020241209210359.png)

**Load Operation**
![Pasted image 20241209210406](Pasted%20image%2020241209210406.png)
![Pasted image 20241209210511](Pasted%20image%2020241209210511.png)

**Store Operation**
* `C` does not update to modified/exclusive state because it is **lazy versioning**
	* Our changes are not observable by others, meaning we have not actually written to `C` yet.
	* We pull `C` into our cache and write into a write buffer.
![Pasted image 20241209210522](Pasted%20image%2020241209210522.png)

**Commit**
* Update the cache line for all things in our write set to modified state.
![Pasted image 20241209210958](Pasted%20image%2020241209210958.png)

**Detect/Abort**
![Pasted image 20241209211159](Pasted%20image%2020241209211159.png)

## Example: Transactional Coherence and Consistency
![Pasted image 20241209211450](Pasted%20image%2020241209211450.png)

* When T2 commits, T4 is aborted because it read `E` which T2 wrote.
![Pasted image 20241209211512](Pasted%20image%2020241209211512.png)
* When T1 commits, no one needs to abort.
	* Even though T3 writes to `C`, because we have optimistic conflict detection (compare committer's write set with read set of others), this is fine.
![Pasted image 20241209211624](Pasted%20image%2020241209211624.png)

* When T4 commits, its the same as last step. Our write to `C` does not cause T3 to abort because it does not read `C`.

# Summary of TM
**Atomic construct: atomic behavior must be preserved by the system**
* Motivating idea: increase simplicity of synchronization without (significantly) sacrificing performance

**Transactional memory implementation**
* Many variants have been proposed: SW, HW, SW+HW
* Implementations differ in:
	* Data versioning policy (eager vs. lazy)
	* Conflict detection policy (pessimistic vs. optimistic)
	* Detection granularity (object, word, cache line)

**Software TM systems (STM)**
* Compiler adds code for versioning & conflict detection
* Note: STM barrier = instrumentation code (e.g.StmRead, StmWrite)
* Basic data-structures
	* Transactional descriptor per thread (status, rd/wrset, …)
	* Transactional record per data (locked/version)

**Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM)**
* Versioned data is kept in caches
* Conflict detection mechanisms augment coherence protocol
